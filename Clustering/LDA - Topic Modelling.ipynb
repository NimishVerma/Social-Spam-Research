       " 'Ich denke, man kann sagen, dass der gr√∂√üte Teil der\\nGesellschaft Homosexualit√§t anerkannt hat. Was man √ºber Bisexualit√§t jedoch\\nnicht sagen kann. In unserer Gesellschaft muss man sich festlegen. Schwarz oder\\nwei√ü, Mann oder Frau und exakt welche Religion man aus√ºbt. Darum finden auch viele\\nMenschen und auch Forscher, das Bisexualit√§t nur eine Orientierungsphase ist\\noder man ist nur gerade ein bisschen verwirrt, denn man muss klarstellen, ob\\nman jetzt auf M√§nner oder Frauen steht. Diese Art von sexueller Orientierung\\nist nicht gern gesehen, da sie unser Schubladendenken st√∂rt und das ist f√ºr\\nViele beunruhigend. Da Bisexualit√§t nicht der gesellschaftlichen Norm\\nunterliegt, f√§llt es vielen Menschen schwer bisexuelle Menschen ernst zu nehmen\\nund werden oft mit den Worten ‚Äûdie/der wei√ü ja selber nicht, was sie/er will‚Äú\\nabgestempelt. Aber genau das ist falsch! Bisexuelle Menschen sind nicht\\nverwirrt, sie wissen ganz genau was sie wollen. Es hei√üt nicht, dass man\\neigentlich schwul oder lesbisch ist, denn mit diesen Worten verweigert man die\\nExistenz von dieser Sexualit√§t. Die Diskriminierung und Vorurteilen mit denen\\nbisexuelle Menschen zu k√§mpfen haben, nennt man auch Biphobie. Dazu kommt auch\\ndas diese Sexualit√§t keinen richtigen Platz in der Gesellschaft findet, denn\\nauf der einen Seite sind sie zu heterosexuell f√ºr die einen Gruppen und zu homosexuell\\nf√ºr die anderen.\\nMan muss jedoch sagen, dass es bei Frauen eher akzeptiert wird wie bei M√§nnern.\\nDa es bei Frauen ‚Äûgeil‚Äú ist, wenn sie auch auf Frauen stehen und M√§nner werden\\nhier noch mehr als ‚Äûsexuell verwirrt‚Äú abgestempelt werden. Vor allem wird ihnen\\neine geminderte M√§nnlichkeit zugeteilt und damit outen sich M√§nner viel\\nseltener als Frauen aus Angst vor der Stigmatisierung. In diesem Sinne erfahren\\nFrauen weniger Diskriminierungen, da ihre Sexualit√§t oft missverstanden wird\\nund eher als Klischee vom ‚Äûflotten Dreier‚Äú gesehen wird. Es gibt bei der Bisexualit√§t keine fixe Norm und wieviel man sich zum\\neigenen Geschlecht und zum anderen hingezogen f√ºhlen muss.Ich definiere mich selber auch als bisexuell und w√ºrde mir\\nw√ºnschen, dass offener damit umgegangen wird und dieses Thema nicht so am Rand\\nder Gesellschaft gedr√§ngt wird. Es ist wichtig, dass man bisexuelle Menschen\\ngenauso ernst nimmt, wie andere sexuellen Orientierungen und sie nicht einfach\\nin irgendeine Schublade steckt. Es f√§llt uns einfach viel schwieriger uns zu\\nouten, wenn man wei√ü, dass man gleich als verwirrt abgestempelt wird.\\nIch will mir einfach selber die Freiheit geben mich in jeden Menschen verlieben\\nzu k√∂nnen. Ich m√∂chte mich in dieser Hinsicht einfach selber nicht eingrenzen.\\nUnd au√üerdem verdoppeln sich die Chancen einen Partner zu finden bei\\nbisexuellen Menschen üòâ Ich will mich aber auch nicht jedes Mal\\nrechtfertigen m√ºssen, wieso ich bisexuell bin und will das auch nicht jedes Mal\\nerkl√§ren, dass man wirklich diese sexuelle Orientierung haben kann. \\xa0https://www.evangelisch.de/blogs/kreuz-queer/125110/23-09-2015https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/ratgeber/sexualitaet/tid-17693/bisexualitaet-liebe-zwischen-den-ufern_aid_492781.htmlQuelle Bild: Pinterest-Juliana',\n",

This past week has seen some new changes for the WhatsApp as testing has started on buttons for muting and marking messages as read. The step is one that seeks to make things easier for the user by allowing them to take action on new messages in WhatsApp, right from their notification bar. The messaging app, which is backed by Facebook, now offers the mute button to any user who has the most recent beta version of WhatsApp for the Android devices.\\nReceiving more than fifty-one notifications from a single contact will now produce the mute button. On another note, it has also been reported that WhatsApp will have a new sticker preview, also recently added. These stickers will be able to be used in the same way that other messaging apps allow. WhatsApp stickers were officially announced at the F8 developer conference for Facebook, which came about this past May. It was actually a counter measure against such apps as Skype and WeChat, which both offer the option of using sticker and have for quite some time now.\\nAs you may have already guessed, the new mute button allows the user to mute certain messages easily if you have received large numbers of messages from a particular user. Better still, you can even use the mute button without actually having to access WhatsApp to do it. The mute button sits right next to the already existing reply button, found on the notification panel.\\nA blogspot recently featured a report that says the mute button is actually part of the beta version 2.18.216 for WhatsApp. Still other reports list it as being a part of even newer beat versions. WABetaInfo also tweeted recently on their official Twitter account, a post that showed two different packs of stickers, one featuring Bibimbap Friends and the other, Unchi and Rollie. It is expected that both of them will make the initial debut, as could stickers that are brought over directly from the Facebook Messenger app as well.\\nApp Downloads\\nDownload WhatsApp\\nMark Zuckerberg, well known CEO of Facebook confirmed the arrival of stickers in the F8 keynote event, held in May 2018. Facebook offered an official post on their blog to further specify the fact that stickers from a third party that were created by developers will be another inclusion offered as a sticker portfolio enhancement. This is expected to make user‚Äôs experiences nicer.\\nExternal imageExternal imageExternal imageExternal imageExternal image(No Ratings Yet)',\n",

       " 'There are actually a million different reasons our clients call us. We are always honored to be trusted by so many people. Here are some of the most popular reasons our clients call us.\\xa0Relationship questions - Most people who call us are looking for relationship advice and help.Forecasting readings - Many of our clients call to get a forecasting reading. This type of reading is helpful when a client has a new beginning. The new beginning may be at the start of a new moon, their birthday, the month or the year - whatever works for the client. We usually recommend a reader who can use some Tarot cards for a forecasting reading. A Tarot card reading can help the reader with past, present and future issues that may affect the timeline of a forecasting reading. Work issues - Work issues can be a big deal in a client‚Äôs happiness. Therefore, many client do ask about work issues. The top areas of focus would be issues with co-workers, applying for jobs, job offers, what career to choose and how to proceed in certain work situations are all common areas of focus. Family issues - Divorce, cheating spouses and dealing with teenage children are the most popular areas of focus. Need someone to talk to -Sometimes you need to talk! We definitely have readers who are extremely fun to talk with who can also focus on the client‚Äôs life. We are here and we love to chat it up. Someone completely outside of their circle to bounce ideas off - We have clients from all walks of life. What we have found two different types of people who love to call when they need an outside opinion that is insightful. People who have talked their friends ears off about a certain issue and their friends are burnt out on it. The second group of clients are the people who are at the top of their career field who can‚Äôt really trust colleagues for advice. Direction to proceed - Sometimes something happens so unexpected a client is looking for hope and direction from a reading. There are certain issues clients do not want to talk to their friends and family about. Cheating spouses and drug addictions of loved ones both fall into this category. Psychics can help give direction when you feel at a loss of what to do and how to proceed. Lost loved ones and grief - We love to help with grief. Grief can be overwhelming and some people find comfort in a psychic reading with a psychic medium. Upcoming or a recent move - When you move, it can be rough. The first type of questions are about whether or not to move or where to move or if you should take the job offer. Once the client has moved, they are usually concerned about meeting people and getting to know their new place in the world. www.thepsychicline.com1-800-966-2294',\n",

       " '\\n\\nWomen these days have bigger dreams to pursue, and goals to achieve. As a result, focusing on motherhood may not be the prime focus of many women who prefer career and education over other responsibilities. Having said this, women have all the right to plan their pregnancy and decide the motherhood period. However, many women are entrapped in the responsibilities such that the good old fertile years pass away without notice. In such times, the chances of starting a family for a woman become negligible, and she might not be able to pursue her dream of motherhood after achieving other dreams. Read more on blog.

       " 'External imageI had the chance to stay at and discover one of the newest casino hotels located outside of the sprawling Entertainment City at Roxas Boulevard. When you think of luxury and entertainment, the big integrated resorts like Resorts World Manila or City of Dreams Manila are usually the first that come to mind. However, not everyone can be a high rolling casino bigwig spending tens of thousands on their visits. Winford Manila Resort and Casino offers an alternative recreation and gaming location with its friendlier rates, averaging at just around P5,000 per night, but with the same opulent and luxurious design.External imageWinford Manila Resort and Casino is a new gleaming structure located at the heart of the San Lazaro Business and Tourism Park. This\\xa0P8-billion hotel and entertainment project lies within a 16-hectare property that used to be a popular horse racetrack run by the Manila Jockey Club. The site has been redeveloped into a more modern mixed-use property anchored by Winford Manila which held its official grand opening early last year.\\xa0\\xa0I wanted to experience this new integrated resort myself, and with their affordable rates, it was easy to book a quick overnight stay.External imageI was quite impressed with the hotel‚Äôs\\xa0exquisite design and interiors, from its spacious lobby all the way to its comfortable rooms. These can compete with any five-star hotel in Makati or at Entertainment City. While the San Lazaro area caters more to the mid-level markets, Winford Manila appears like a golden treasure chest as it offers an alternative venue for the\\xa0Filipino-Chinese gaming communities in the Greater Chinatown area.\\xa0External imageYou don‚Äôt really need to go to the casino to enjoy a staycation at Winford Manila because the\\xa022-story hotel comes with 128\\xa0internationally designed rooms and suites plus modern facilities to ensure a relaxing visit. The eight-level parking structure offers free parking for guests and the hotel also\\xa0has a grand ballroom that can accommodate 600 guests for conferences, weddings, and special events. SM City San Lazaro is also just right across the street so you can easily go shopping or dining at the mall.External imageEach room at Winford Manila Resort and Casino\\xa0boasts of sleek d√©cor that incorporates subtle colors and themes for an Asian-inspired touch. I stayed at the Deluxe Room which has 29 square meters of comfortable space. My room comes with a king-sized bed that is so relaxing. While the view outside the window may not be comparable to that of Resorts World Manila, everything I need can be found right here inside the hotel.External imageExternal imageThe deluxe room also features a 40-inch flat screen television plus a work desk, minibar and fridge. You can find touches of art and elegance all over the room with its classy furniture and contemporary designs.External imageExternal imageEven the bathroom is quite lovely with its rain shower and elegant toiletries. I was actually content with just staying inside my room all afternoon, but I still had to explore the other areas around the hotel.External imageThe gaming facilities of Winford Manila can be found mostly on the second floor\\xa0with several slot machines and gaming tables. The area is not as big as the other integrated resorts, but it does cater to a more targeted market with its lower minimum bets. I even signed up for their Winford Rewards on the ground floor and I immediately got my Winner‚Äôs Booklet which comes with many interesting freebies and promotions.External imageThe outdoor swimming pool can be found on the 11th floor and it offers both an adult‚Äôs and a kid‚Äôs area. Beside it is the pool bar which is a great place to unwind especially during the evenings.External imageExternal imageAlso on this level is the hotel‚Äôs\\xa0Fitness Center for those who want to get a quick workout during their visit.\\xa0External imageI also took the opportunity to get a pampering massage at the SM Kenko Spa and luckily, my Winner‚Äôs Booklet came with a voucher for a 50% discount on any treatment! That‚Äôs just one of the perks of being a Winford Rewards member.External imageThere are also a couple of dining options within the hotel. Choi Garden Manila can be found on the second level offering authentic Cantonese cuisine.External imageI dropped by the restaurant for some light afternoon snacks so I ordered their Egg Custard Bun as well as a few dimsum items. The Winford Manila outlet is actually Choi Garden‚Äôs biggest and most luxurious branch in Metro Manila and they even had Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada and\\xa0Alliance Global CEO Andrew Tan\\xa0for the ribbon cutting ceremonies last August (Read:\\xa0Choi Garden Opens Its Biggest Branch at Winford Hotel & Casino).External imageCopa de Manila is another dining option on the ground floor offering Filipino-Spanish Cuisine. They have a daily lunch and dinner buffet that is also quiet affordable at around P499 nett per person. But since I was a new member of Winford Rewards, another benefit I got was that I can have a buffet at Copa de Manila for only P198 nett. That‚Äôs amazing!External imageExternal imageWhile the buffet may not be that extensive compared to other hotel cafes, I still enjoyed their appetizers and main dishes all displayed on the table. Some of the highlights included Callos, a familiar Spanish dish made with ox tripe, and crispy Fish Fillet with tartar sauce.External imageExternal imageThe carving station had this huge Roast Chicken which was both tasty and juicy. Coffee, tea, and juices are also included with the buffet and you really can‚Äôt go wrong with this price.External imageExternal imageA few desserts are also available and these will give guests the energy to try their luck later at the casino. Aside from the gaming facilities, Winford Manila also features an entertainment venue called Hippodrome Bar and Lounge, named after San Lazaro‚Äôs famed horse racetrack. This area on the second floor showcases world-class entertainment from popular acts both here and abroad.External imageThe next morning, after an enjoyable and relaxing slumber inside my room, I headed down again to Copa de Manila for my breakfast buffet. The first place I approached was the Egg Station for some fried eggs and omelettes.\\xa0External imageThere are many other delicious breakfast items on the buffet table like these Eggs Benedict and all the Bacon that you want. It was a great way to end my short staycation at Winford Manila. The hotel does offer great value as it gives its guests a luxurious stay at a very affordable price.\\xa0External imageWinford Manila Resort and CasinoSan Lazaro Tourism & Business Park, MJC Drive, Sta.

       " 'The corporation Dun and Bradstreet assigns a special credit score to a business called a Paydex. That score rates the likelihood of any given business to repay vendors, suppliers, and creditors in a timely manner. Unlike personal credit scores which range from 0 to 850, a Paydex score ranges from 0 to 100. The higher the number, the better your chances of getting an unsecured business line of credit to pay for expansions, employees, supplies, and other business-related expenses. By responsibly utilizing an 80 Paydex program, you essentially put your business in a low-risk category. An 80 or better score indicates that your payment history is timely and therefore has a decreased chance of being repaid late. Understanding How the Paydex Is Used by Your Business Your personal credit rating is used primarily to measure the financial hazard you present to lenders, or lack thereof. However, a Paydex score is used in several more ways. For example, it can affect the premiums and APRs that your business is required to pay on credit cards and bank loans. An 80 Paydex score lowers the interest rates charged to your company and puts your business in line to receive better unsecured funding products.Another way that your Paydex score is used typically doesn‚Äôt apply to consumers, and that‚Äôs when it comes to borrowing from vendors. Vendors deliver goods and services before invoicing the business and then receive payment for those goods and services after the delivery. As a result, vendors must assume a certain level of risk that they won‚Äôt be paid. So, the Paydex score of a business is a useful metric for determining whether a client will leave a vendor hanging. Poor Paydex scores make suppliers naturally reluctant to do business, and may ultimately limit the size and scope of goods and services they‚Äôre willing to part with before being paid.Knowing how to build corporate credit fast by establishing an attractive business credit Paydex score is the only way to succeed in this highly competitive economy. It‚Äôs important that you know what goes into a Paydex score. Additionally, it‚Äôs vital to be aware of how your business spending habits affect that. How a Paydex Score Is CalculatedTo get corporate credit and use it as intended, you must understand how a Paydex score is determined. Put simply, your score is calculated based on a history of trade references regarding your business. Instead of looking solely at your business‚Äôs history of financing from lenders, Dun and Bradstreet uses a company‚Äôs various payment histories with the vendors and suppliers it works with. As such, Dun and Bradstreet recommends that a business have at least four separate trade references on file to accurately calculate a Paydex score.Although most trade references remain on a business credit report for quite some time, only those reported within the last 2 years are used to calculate a Paydex score. Therefore, it is often difficult for new businesses to establish corporate credit without a workable strategy. It is in a company‚Äôs best interest to maintain a consistent flow of trade references and have them reported in a timely manner. Unfortunately, credit card payments don‚Äôt count as a trade experience. What Qualifies as a Trade Experience? Businesses often face the challenge of locating enough vendors to meet the minimum trade experiences needed to receive a Paydex score. In fact, some smaller vendors don‚Äôt report their transactions to Duns and Bradstreet without provocation. This is generally the underlying issue for businesses in the service industry, because they don‚Äôt work with many suppliers. Tech startups have this problem as well, since they usually have very few outside needs. For businesses like that, finding trade experiences means knowing where to look.One way to increase trade experience is to use accountants, lawyers, and landlords as references, but only if those relationships are billed through invoices and have relative payment terms. Additionally, setting up a business account with a major office supply store can help, as they usually report trade accounts directly to Dun and Bradstreet automatically. Then again, having plenty of trade experience won‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt have an active account with Dun and Bradstreet to begin with. How to Get Your Paydex Score To get a Paydex score at all, your business must be registered with Dun and Bradstreet with a valid DUNS number. Although DUNS numbers are assigned to each location of your business, your Paydex score is assigned to the headquarters. So, if your company has numerous offices that work with suppliers separately, you should always use the primary DUNS number with vendors. This will help you get a Paydex score by generating plenty of trade experience. Tips to Improve Your Paydex Score FastEstablishing a business credit Paydex score is only half the battle. You must know how to manage it and improve upon it when necessary. A Paydex rating is designed to measure a company‚Äôs financial responsiveness, so it‚Äôs vital to maintain high scores within the company as a whole. Businesses should negotiate longer payment terms with each vendor to increase the probability of on-time payments and ensure that the company‚Äôs trade experiences reflect positively on the Paydex.Keep in mind also that only references from the past two years have a direct effect on your score. Recent trade experiences are thus more valuable and will have a greater impact. Furthermore, the relative size of each unsecured business line of credit weighs heavily on your overall rating. As such, payment histories on larger accounts will affect your Paydex more than the payment histories on small accounts. For example, paying a $20,000 bill late will affect your Paydex score a lot more than paying off a smaller $500 bill would. Choose your battles wisely or work with a team of professionals who can help you get your Paydex to 80 fast. Moreover, understanding what each of the values on your Paydex score means is an important factor to properly managing and improving your rating. While businesses shouldn‚Äôt be concerned about having a perfect score, business owners should do everything within their power to adequately elevate their rating through a feasible 80 Paydex program. To get enough corporate credit to successfully run and improve your business, it‚Äôs vital that you set out to establish business credit as soon as possible.This article was written for Grand Teton Professionals for Corporate Cash Credit.

       " 'It‚Äôs important to properly establish business credit\\nbefore you submit applications with lenders. Although unsecured business credit\\ndoesn‚Äôt require a co-signer or collateral, it‚Äôs still vital that you build up\\nyour corporate credit rating before applying for small business loans. Doing so\\nhelps in at least two main ways: ¬∑\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt\\nallows you to maintain a credit history that is separate from your personal\\ncredit report.¬∑\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt\\ndemonstrates a favorable separation between the business owners and the\\nbusiness itself. When you build business credit quickly, you can enjoy the benefits of\\nhaving a creditworthy enterprise without doing damage to your personal credit\\nrating. Sometimes, finding the money to maintain and/or expand your business is\\ndifficult. Those who don‚Äôt have adequate corporate credit usually end up using\\ntheir own money to suffice. By having a business credit history that remains\\nseparated from your personal one, you thereby minimize the effect of any negative\\nmarks that one may have on the other. For instance, if you suffer a few\\nfinancial setbacks on your personal credit report, they won‚Äôt impact your\\nbusiness credit as much if you have established a clear line between the two.\\nThe same is true about your business credit, as it won‚Äôt affect your personal\\nreport nearly as much if your business credit has already been well\\nestablished. There is an exception to the rule, however. If you‚Äôre\\noperating the business under sole proprietorship or a general partnership, it‚Äôs\\nessential that you demonstrate a separation between personal and business\\ncredit. Small business loans are difficult to come by when one or more of the\\nsole proprietors is failing with their personal finances. Before you apply for business credit\\nfrom any lender, consider using a business credit building program. Keep your protective measure intact by consistently\\nshowing a clear separation between owners‚Äô credit history and business credit\\nhistory. Incorporated businesses and limited liability companies (LLCs) provide\\nbusiness owners with a form of protection for their personal assets. A good business credit building\\nprogram can help you incorporate properly before the two reports get\\nmixed. 6 Steps to\\nBuilding Business Credit Quickly There are several benefits to having good business\\ncredit aside from the ability to keep your personal credit separated. Favorable\\ncredit positions your company for better payment terms and lower interest rates\\non small business loans\\nand corporate credit cards. It makes your company look more attractive to\\nvendors and suppliers as well, reducing the number of times you need to repay\\nfor the goods and services required. Once your good business credit has been built, be sure\\nto monitor and protect it in the same way that you monitor and protect your\\npersonal credit. If getting a corporate credit card sounds like a good fit for\\nyour business, be sure to build business credit quickly to get the best deals.\\nIf you‚Äôre like many business owners and don‚Äôt know where to start, consider the\\nfollowing steps before you apply for secured or unsecured business credit:\\n1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Before You Apply For Business\\nCredit Incorporate Your Business With sole proprietorships and general partnerships,\\nthe owner is legally the same as the business. Unfortunately, this can make\\ncredit history separation impossible and make it very difficult to build\\nbusiness credit quickly enough to operate the venture properly. By\\nincorporating the business or by forming a simple LLC, it creates a business\\nthat is legally separated from the owners and makes it easier to apply for\\nbusiness credit. The best business credit building program can help you\\nincorporate properly and in a timely manner. 2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Before You Apply For Business\\nCredit Establish a Business Bank Account Opening a bank account that‚Äôs strictly for business\\nexpenses and income is important, just make sure it is opened with your\\nbusiness‚Äôs legal name. Once open, be sure to pay the financial obligations of\\nyour business from that account exclusively and never mix up your personal and\\nbusiness accounts. If you use an unsecured business credit card to pay for\\nthings related to your company, pay the bill using that account only. Keep\\nrecords of your expenditures and deposits for tax purposes. 3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Before You Apply For Business\\nCredit Get a Federal Tax ID Number (EIN)An EIN (or employer identification number) is\\nbasically just a social security number for your business. It‚Äôs required for\\nall tax filings and is also needed to open a business bank account, especially\\nif you‚Äôve incorporated or formed an LLC. To properly comply with IRS mandates,\\nmost larger businesses need an EIN from their vendors to pay for goods and\\nservices. Furthermore, an EIN makes you look more established to potential\\ncreditors as well, not to mention it helps you build business credit quickly by\\ninstantly separating your personal credit report from your corporate one. 4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Before You Apply For Business\\nCredit Establish a Line of Credit with Vendors When you work with at least 3 to 5 vendors to supply your\\nbusiness with its necessary accouterments, it creates credit for your company.\\nHowever, when you create a line of credit for your company through a few of\\nthose vendors, it expedites the credit building process tremendously. Just make\\nsure you pay bills in full and on time and see to it that each vendor reports\\nyour payments to the credit reporting agencies. 5.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Before You Apply For Business Make\\nSure You Are Paying ALL Your Bills on Time Paying your bills in a timely manner is one of the\\nbest ways to boost your business credit scores quickly. Like your personal\\ncredit profile, late payments will negatively impact your business\\ncreditworthiness and make it difficult to get financing. On-time payments over\\na long period of time can increase your credit scores significantly. However, if you fall on hard times, apply for business\\ncredit before you default on bills to protect the integrity of your enterprise.\\nIf your business is not in the position to get approved for small business\\nloans, consider purchasing a credit-ready aged corporation to improve your\\nchances and increase the amount of money you can get. 6.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Before You Apply For Business\\nCredit Get Your Business Listed Having a legitimate, working business phone number\\nand/or website is a good way to gain trust through market transparency.

       " 'Could Student Loans Lead to Debt Prison? The Handwriting on the WallExternal image\\nPhoto by DonkeyHotey | CC BY 2.0\\nHolders of student loans ‚Äìmost of whom are no longer students‚Äìcarry a combined debt burden that stands at a record high of $1.5 trillion, more than 8 percent of GDP and more than the $1.3 trillion in direct costs of waging war against Iraq.\\nThe Desirability of Cancelling Student Debts\\nThe burden weighing like a nightmare, to coin a phrase, on 44 million indebted current and former students will haunt these people for a good portion of their lives. The average student debtor graduates owing close to $34,000 and is projected to spend 21 years paying it off. At present, the average monthly payment for those between 30 and 40 years old is $351.00. It is not uncommon for repayment obligations to be borne by underwriters of these loans, typically the primary borrower‚Äôs parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles. Taking these co-signers into consideration, we have about 100 million people adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by the difficulty very many have repaying these loans.\\nBecause it is hard to have loans dismissed or renegotiated on the grounds of undue hardship, cases like the following are numerous: a 2008 graduate entered the job market with $50,000 in student debt. After the September meltdown he was laid off from his $29,000 a year job and had no choice but to default. His mother, a laid-off factory worker, had underwritten his loan, and so $120.00 of her $300.00 unemployment check was garnished in order to service her son‚Äôs federal loan. Her plea that this arrangement imposed undue hardship fell on deaf ears.\\nRenegotiating the terms of a subprime mortgage, no mean feat, is easier than having the terms of a student loan readjusted. After her home was foreclosed and she managed to have her mortgage renegotiated due to bankruptcy, Sallie Mae refused to rewrite a woman‚Äôs student loan. She was allowed, however, to defer payment. Extensions and postponements went on for 14 years, the original loan of $28,000 had increased to more than $90,000 and monthly payments had jumped from $230.00 to $816.00.\\nDefault charges, relentlessly compounding interest rates and collection-agency fees make up a hefty portion of current student-loan debts. A medical student graduated owing about $250,000. Residency and an unexpected serious illness forced her to defer payments after a number of inevitable default charges. When her loan was turned over to a collection agency a $53,870 fee was added. By this time her debt stood at $555,000.\\nIn these times when the typical new job represents an ‚Äúalternative work arrangement,‚Äù i.e. part-time, low-pay work (1) and an increasing percentage of employed workers are stuck in this type of job, trying to keep up with loan repayments is taking a punishing toll on debtors. Reuters reports that at least 1 in 4 is either sacrificing health care, vacations, new home buying and other elements of a decent standard of living, or is in default. A good number of student debts are in fact debts that simply cannot be repaid.\\nTwo recent studies throw light on what it would look like, in specific and workable terms, if steps were taken to cancel a student debt burden that for many is literally unbearable, and what it threatens to look like if nothing is done. The Levy Economics Institute has released The Macroeconomic Effects of Student Debt Cancellation (2) and the American Civil Liberties Union has produced the truly scary A Pound of Flesh  The Criminalization of Private Debt. (3)\\nThe Levy study is more than mildly wonkish; the co-authors produce data series, tables and lay out balance sheet mechanics for a range of scenarios under which student debt can be actually cancelled within the framework of the existing financial system. In this article I will merely sketch their main claims and state their basic conclusions. I conclude with a description of what looks a lot like the rebirth of debtors‚Äô prisons as a response to the superfluity of Americans bearing unbearable debt burdens.\\nThe Mechanics of Cancelling Student Debts\\nMost writing on student debt details the magnitude of the burden and the inhuman consequences visited upon debtors who struggle to make payments or who just can‚Äôt pay. Until the Levy study we have seen nothing spelling out the mechanics of how to actually go about cancelling student debt, (4) or demonstrating the positive effects on the economy of making it possible for income currently shackled to debt repayment to be spent for other purposes. (5)\\nStudent debt can be cancelled as a political project either by government or by the Federal Reserve. Government can finance the cancellation of student debt in a number of ways including: cancelling whole hog the Department of Education‚Äôs (DE) loans, whereby all the loans disappear simultaneously; cancelling DE‚Äôs loans serially, as payments come due; effectively cancelling loans issued by private lenders by assuming payment of these loans; effectively cancelling loans issued by private lenders by simultaneously purchasing and cancelling these loans, or by purchasing these private loans and then cancelling principal as payments come due.\\nFor those whose ideological predilections favor private solutions to social problems, the Federal Reserve can carry out student debt cancellation by: purchasing DE‚Äôs loans and cancelling them all at once; cancelling the payments for the DE loans; taking over debt service payments to private lenders; purchasing private loans and cancelling payments; simultaneously purchasing and cancelling loans owned by private lenders; purchasing loans issued by private lenders and cancelling principal as payments come due.\\nAny of these steps would free students, former students and co-signers from making any future payments on current outstanding student loan debt. Most importantly, the U.S. financial system as such, i.e. apart from political limitations of choice imposed by discretionary legislation, consists of no structural features entailing the impossibility or undesirability of legislating any of the above measures. Recall that the multi-trillion dollar bailout of the banks was effected without a dime of taxpayer money, as then-Fed-chairman Ben Bernanke averred on 60 Minutes. The Fed simply plucked what was ‚Äúneeded‚Äù out of thin air, the way all government money is created. And the redirection of interest payments to consumption spending would not trigger inflation, because (official false assertions of full employment aside) discouraged workers out of the labor force, and workers who want but cannot find full-time employment  -and all these number very many-   would use the money to put the 20-25 percent of America‚Äôs now idle productive capacity to use. An economy with this much slack will not generate unmanageable inflation when idle capacity, human and non-human, is put to work.\\nWith respect to the Fed‚Äìa private institution remember, whose seven Board members are bankers‚Äìit is perceived need that typically determines the strategies that the Fed is willing to pursue. Needs are class-relative. Bankers needed to be rescued from insolvency, hence the bailout. Working-class homeowners are not among the Fed‚Äôs governors, nor are their needs the same as bankers‚Äô. Virtually nothing was done to benefit those with foreclosed homes. The owners of the Fed have no interest in addressing the needs of desperate debtors. On the contrary, the Fed‚Äôs constituency loves the unending flow of interest payments. What is required to make the possible actual is a national movement, led perhaps by groups like Strike the Debt, marching, disrupting and striking in the name of debt cancellation.\\nThe Benefits of Cancelling Student Debt\\nSuch a movement would educate the population about the current state and social costs of student loan debt. The Levy study, essential for activists, provides the relevant details. It also reminds us that the interest payments on this debt represent not only a significant reduction of debtors‚Äô financial resources, but a substantial sum that has been diverted from alternative, productive uses. The interest payments currently extracted from households are unproductive, increase the insecurity of the working class and go straight to the very wealthy. The effect of wholesale debt cancellation would be to redirect funds now bound to debt service to productive, rather than extractive, uses. The immediate effect would be to boost consumption demand, which would in turn spill over into other forms of spending like increasing production and hiring workers. The study finds that, over a ten-year forecast, cancellation could raise GDP $86-108 billion a year, reduce the average unemployment rate by 0.22-0.36 percentage points, and add from 1.2 to 1.5 million new jobs per year. And by ending the debt-payment drain on household resources, working people‚Äôs vulnerability during business cycle downturns would be reduced.\\nCancellation of all student-loan debt, then, is both feasible and desirable. Let‚Äôs get on with it.\\nThe Criminalization of Private Debt\\nElites are well aware that what is in store for the majority of the working population is a future of declining living standards, contingent, low-paying work, debt peonage and declining social services ‚Äì in a word, secular austerity. High levels of imprisonment, burgeoning surveillance, the suppression by Google and Facebook of access to alternative, independent sources of critical social, political and economic commentary and the militarization of an increasingly brutal police force are repressive measures enacted in ruling-class anticipation of the widespread social dislocation that must attend long-term austerity.\\nDebtors have been targeted for severe punishment lest they try ‚Äúto get something for nothing,‚Äù i.e. fail to service debts they are unable to pay. The ACLU study provides a wealth of information for educators and organizers. The number of debtors in serious trouble is startling. One in three Americans has a debt that has been turned over to a private collection agency. One in five Americans has unpaid medical bills that have gone into collection.\\nStudent-loan debtors have been in the court system‚Äôs bullseye. A Texas man was arrested by seven or eight U.S. Marshals for failure to appear in court. The original $2,500 federal student loan he obtained in 1983 to pay for trucking school had ballooned to $12,000 with interest and fees. The man was not merely unwilling, he was unable to appear in court: he had just undergone open-heart surgery. Had he been able to appear, it would still have been unable to pay. He was retired and subsisting on Social Security and disability. In most cases like this, the court has not cared.\\nFailure to appear in court for the ‚Äújudgment debtor exam‚Äù is grounds for creditors to have the judge issue a civil warrant for the debtor‚Äôs arrest. Failure to appear in court is the major grounds for the issuance of a warrant and/or arrest. Among common reasons for failing to appear include work obligations, child care responsibilities, lack of transportation, physical disability, illness or dementia. These legitimate excuses rarely carry weight with the courts. ACLU found cases in which warrants were issued to terminally ill debtors who died shortly after the warrants were issued. But most often debtors failed to appear because they were not notified of the court date, or, more scandalously, they were not even notified of the existence of the lawsuit. The ineptitude of the courts‚Äô procedures stands in sharp contrast to the relentlessness with which the courts, in collusion with debt collectors, hound the indebted. In Maryland a man, 83 and his wife, 78, were jailed because they did not appear at a show cause hearing in a district court. (Ineptitude and inattention abounds: the server described the man as 41 years old and his wife as his 28 year old roommate.) The issue was $2,342.76 owed to a homeowners‚Äô association, plus $450 in attorney‚Äôs fees. Not atypically, the couple had never been served notice of the hearing; they were out of the country when the process server claimed to have performed service. Adding insult to injury, the show cause hearing had been scheduled for the couple‚Äôs failure to appear at a post-judgement proceeding, for which they had also never been served.\\nIn this case, like many others, the couple was arrested and a cash-only bond was set in the amount of $2,900, more than the default judgement against them. Of course if the default payment was unaffordable, so was the bond payment. An increasing percentage of locked-up debtors remain incarcerated simply because they cannot afford bail.\\nTurning State and Local Courts Into Collectors‚Äô Courts\\nMore than 6,000 debt collection firms collect billions of dollars a year for the creditors who hire them. Millions of collection lawsuits are filed each year in state and local courts. These are the majority of cases on many state court dockets, and in many state courts debt purchasers file more suits than any other type of plaintiff. Frequently the courts require no evidence that the alleged debt is actually owed. In theory, this should work in the defendant‚Äôs favor, but the vast majority of these defendants are not represented by a lawyer. The sheer numbers of this type of case lead the courts to barrel through collection suits with great speed and virtually no scrutiny. The debtor is doomed from the outset. Over 95 percent of debt collection suits end in favor of the collector.\\nThe implications of this entire setup are more far reaching than the harm described above done to debtors. The damage includes lost wages, lost jobs and psychological distress. And the debtor need not be jailed in order for these damages to take their toll. An arrest warrant by itself can wreak long-lasting havoc on the debtors‚Äô lives: warrants are entered into background check databases, which can jeopardize future employment, educational opportunities, housing applications and access to security clearances.\\nThe ACLU study, from which much of the above has been drawn, documents the pervasiveness of this wholesale and mounting assault on the indebted and the poor. This is but one of the strategies employed in the elite attempt to re-make America into a society that has discarded the protections of the New Deal/Great Society heritage. And of the Constitution. Here we have yet another instance of the effort to return America to the settlement of the 1920s. The deliberate attempt to addict households to debt even as debtors are subject to unremitting prosecution-persecution is but one of the abominations of the march of neoliberalism.\\nBecause the serving of warrants and jailing of debtors has begun picking up steam in recent years, and the financial situation of these potential prisoners has been gradually deteriorating, we have reason to expect that student-loan debtors could come to make up a significant portion of the growing ranks of those threatened with debt prison. Arrest warrants have been issued in California, Florida, Minnesota, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts and Texas. Arrests have been heaviest in California, Texas and Minnesota. In many cases there was no announcement of court orders or that the debtor was being sued. U.S. marshals in Minnesota conducted ‚ÄúOperation Anaconda Squeeze‚Äù to arrest student-loan debtors who had failed to appear in court for a ‚Äúdebtor‚Äôs examination.‚Äù Whether they had received prior notice was often thought by the court to be beside the point. As with the cases described earlier, often defendants are ordered to pay much more than the amount of the original loan. A Texas man, who received no prior notice about the debt or the court case brought by a private collection agency on behalf of Uncle Sam, was arrested by seven armed U.S. marshals for an unpaid $1,500 student loan he had borrowed 29 years earlier. He was ordered to pay, after interest and court fees, more than twice the amount of the original loan. $1,258.60 was added to reimburse the marshals for his arrest.\\nNote that these actions, often conducted by armed marshals, display the ongoing militarization of society that we must expect as creeping austerity becomes the new normal.\\nPrivate and Public Debt in the History of American Capitalism\\nThe respective impacts on the economy of private and public debt are thoroughly misconstrued in official propaganda. Political and economic elites make no fuss over the accumulation of massive private debt. It is public debt that unsettles the plutocrats. Mounting public debt and deficits are held to portend State bankruptcy. Private and public debt have produced consistent respective results over the course of U.S. capitalist development, and they are the opposite of what the Party Line puts forward. It is private debt that generates crisis, and federal deficits that ward off depression. Here are the relevant facts.\\nOf all the developed capitalist countries since the end of the Second World War, America has offered its workers the most niggardly social democratic benefits. The so-called social safety net has been either non-existent or insufficient to provide working-class households with a modicum of material security. Low private-sector wages and a paltry welfare State have made debt  -unsustainable debt at that‚Äìa necessary supplement to the reward for work. This is clearly illustrated in the only two periods in American history when there appeared to be a thriving middle class, namely the 1920s and the Golden Age of 1949-1973.\\nDuring the 1920s, when wages were stagnant, the proportion of total retail sales financed by credit increased from 10 percent in 1910 to 15 percent in 1927 to 50 percent in 1929. Because 71 percent of households stood on or below the poverty line during that decade, the ratio of household debt to household income rose steadily through the 1920s. In 1923, 1924, 1924, 1927 and 1928, the ratios stood at, respectively, 13, 18, 22, 25 and 31 percent. That most working-class households were in penury during these years was disguised by the supplementing of poverty-level wages with mounting debt. When debt rises faster than income the debt must be unsustainable. When the limits of household debt were reached around 1926, the especially rapid rise in the production and consumption of durable goods that propelled the decade‚Äôs growth rates could not be maintained. By 1929 there was a troubling decline in investment and in the demand for types of durable goods most responsible for the post-1921 growth surge. The stage was set for the Great Depression.\\nA similar scenario characterized the Golden Age. In 1946 the ratio of household debt to disposable income stood at about 24 percent. By 1950 it had risen to 38 percent, by 1955 to 53 percent, by 1960 to 62 percent, and by 1965 to 72 percent. The ratio fluctuated from 1966 to 1978, but the stagnation of real wages which began in 1974 pressured households further to increase their debt burden in order to maintain living standards, just as they had done during the 1920s, pushing the ratio of debt to disposable income to 77 percent by 1979. By the mid-1980s, with neoliberalism in full swing and wages continuing to stagnate, the ratio began a steady ascent, from 80 percent in 1985 to 88 percent in 1990 to 95 percent in 1995 to over 100 percent in 2000 to 138 percent in 2007. When the housing bubble first showed signs of leakage in 2006, the percentage of total household debt consisting of mortgage debt rose from 68 to 76 percent. As debt rose relative to workers‚Äô income, households‚Äô margin of security against insolvency began to erode. The ratio of personal saving to disposable income under neoliberalism began a steady decline, falling from 11 percent in 1983 to 2.3 percent in 1999. There followed the burst of the housing bubble and a dramatic decline in working-class living standards in the Great Recession.\\nWhile in America household debt accumulation has been necessary to provide the appearance of prosperity, it has never been sufficient. So deep-seated is American capitalism‚Äôs tendency to stagnation that federal deficits have been necessary to avert economic crisis. For almost all of its history the U.S. has run deficits; they have been and remain the norm. There have been only seven historical U.S. attempts to balance the budget and reduce the national debt. Each has resulted in depression or Great Recession. The first six attempts (1817-21, 1823-36, 1852-57, 1867-73, 1880-93 and 1920-30) were quickly followed by depressions. The seventh, Clinton‚Äôs 1998-99 surplus, was followed by a crash eight years later. The delay was effected by a historic boost to demand provided by the unprecedented household credit explosion of the late 1990s up to the crash of September 2008.\\nAn exhaustive study released by the National Bureau of Economic Research analyzed 138 years of economic history in 14 advanced capitalist economies. It concludes that a major cause of severe economic downturns is high levels of private debt. (6) Michael Hudson has made a powerful case for the re-emergence of debt peonage as the chronic condition of the working class absent profound structural political-economic change. In my forthcoming (June) book Overripe Economy  American Capitalism and the Crisis of Democracy, I discuss the features of the historical evolution of U.S. capitalism that have led to the current settlement, the major transformations now under way, and what a genuinely democratic political economy must look like.\\nNotes.\\n(1) Lawrence F.

       " 'via http://bit.ly/2Lab6yD Let us tell you a little story about Kevin and Tracy.\\nThey went to the same junior high school in southern Illinois, just a couple of shy kids. Kevin had a crush on Tracy. Tracy liked him, too. But neither of them ever acted on it. Their friends could see it. They commented on it, but Tracy and Kevin were just too shy.\\nIt went on like this through high school. He never even asked her on a date. Somewhere in there, he got involved with preparing for college and that took up a lot of his attention‚Ä¶but the crush remained.\\nAfter graduation, he went off to school at M.I.T. and nearly forgot about Tracy‚Ä¶but not quite. A couple years later, on a visit back home, he discovered she‚Äôd gotten married to another guy they‚Äôd both gone to school with. It hurt. It was only 20 years later, after Kevin was married (he‚Äôs somehow become a bit more assertive) that he found Tracy on social media and they both had a laugh about it.\\nCute story‚Äîlike something from a romantic comedy, right?\\nYour business is not a comedy but ‚ÄúThe Story of Kevin and Tracy‚Äù is a strong lesson for any business.\\nHave you guessed what it is?\\nYou Must Always Ask\\nIt‚Äôs your call to action. Businesses do this in different ways, from the crude-but-sometimes-effective ‚ÄúBuy Now!‚Äù to these more refined calls:\\n‚ÄúA 15-minute call could save you 15% on your car insurance‚Äù\\n‚ÄúCall now for a free quote‚Äù\\n‚ÄúOrder now to receive a free gift‚Äù\\n‚ÄúCall before June 3rd for a 10% discount‚Äù\\nWe are frequently blown away by how many businesses don‚Äôt include a call to action on their marketing. Some people think that calls to action are ‚Äúsalesy‚Äù‚Äìuncool or cheesy. Truly, there are some cheesy and corny calls to action out there. Some people just neglect to include a call to action because they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary or they don‚Äôt recognize its importance.\\nCall to Action = Results\\nThere is a huge difference in results between marketing that includes a call to action and marketing that doesn‚Äôt.\\nFor instance, WordStream reported that having a single, strong call to action in your marketing can increase sales by more than 1,600%.\\nThe results-boosting power of a call to action applies, regardless of how you market. For instance, posting a call to action button on your Facebook page can increase click-through rate by 285%.\\nKevin and Tracy, Again‚Ä¶\\nThere is no guarantee that Tracy would have said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to Kevin if he‚Äôd asked her out‚Äîor asked him to marry her. But it‚Äôs a sure bet that neither ‚Äúyes‚Äù would have happened if Kevin hadn‚Äôt given Tracy his ‚Äúcall to action.‚Äù\\nYou miss 100% of the responses/sales that you fail to ask for.\\nAlways include a call to action!\\nAnd here‚Äôs ours: Log on to www.prospectsplus.com/pei right now and design your next post card (and remember your call to action).

       " 'via http://bit.ly/2Lsh3b9 The purpose of a marketing plan is to isolate the key elements and actions of how you win and keep customers, and ultimately to attain a specific marketing goal. Marketing goals are things like ‚Äúincrease sales ten percent‚Äù or ‚Äúsuccessfully move into ___ market.‚Äù\\xa0 With a plan in place, you always know what to do and how to do it, so you‚Äôre not having to dream up new ideas with every campaign.\\nA marketing plan embodies your marketing strategy‚Äîthe overall vision for the marketing of your business‚Äîbut also the shorter-term sales goals and actions you will take to meet them.\\nFollowing these five steps to work out your plan:\\n1.) Analyze the Current Scene\\nWhere does your company currently stand?\\nThis is not a trick question or one that requires a lot of over-analyzing. Rather, you need only to state what you company is and what it does; what products or services it offers; the benefits of those products or services; and what it is about your company that makes you preferable to your competition.\\nBe brutally honest with yourself: look not only at your company‚Äôs strengths but also its weaknesses. Strengths would be such things as what makes your product and/or service better than the rest; what it is about your company that gives it an advantage over the competition.\\nBut then also consider the weaknesses: Is your market highly competitive? Do you face any sort of competitive threat? Is the company strong internally? Are there areas that need improvement?\\n2.) Identify Your Target Audience\\nHow well do you know your ideal customer? Let‚Äôs start with something general and move forward to specifics.\\nWrite a simple customer profile. Include the concrete demographics, such as age, geography, and income. Then move into their buying habits, such as how often they purchase your kind of product or service, as well as why‚Äîis it on the basic of convenience? Price? Quality?\\nThen take it a step further, looking\\xa0who your customer really is‚Äìtheir attitude and personal convictions:\\nDo they lean towards innovation or conventionality?\\nAre they outspoken and active or withdrawn?\\nAre they leaders or followers?\\nAre they modern or more traditional?\\nYou can do this kind of customer analysis and summary, even if your customers are other businesses. In that case, you would focus on the type and size of business, the job titles you deal with and other similar and relevant factors.\\n3.) Establish Your Current Marketing Goal\\nThe entire purpose of the marketing plan is to help you reach your marketing goal. For a business that‚Äôs up and running more or less successfully, goals are typically expressed like the following:\\nIncrease sales by 10%\\nExpand into a new geographical territory\\nExpand into a new market\\nFor a new business, the goal may be as simple as ‚Äúbring on 10 new clients.‚Äù\\nThere may be more than one goal, so make a list and ensure that each list item is something that has an end to it, so you will know when you‚Äôve reached it.\\n4.) Work Out How to Communicate to Customers and Prospects\\nWhile this blog is focused on direct mail marketing with postcards, we realize that you may have found success reaching certain classes of prospects via other marketing channels.\\nWork out how to best reach prospects at every step of the sales cycle‚Äîfrom cold prospects (postcards are excellent for this group and we can help you\\xa0find and reach more of them in your geographical area)\\xa0to warmer prospects, all the way to your active customers.\\nThe best to way to figure out which channel is the best one to reach a particular prospect on is to identify where this prospect class goes to gather information about the kind of product or service you sell. For instance, if you find that a certain segment of your potential prospects subscribe to a particular person‚Äôs or company‚Äôs blog, subscribe to it and read it. I will give you ideas on what this audience expects and appreciates‚Äîinformation you can use to inform your own approach.\\n5.) Decide What Your Marketing Budget Will Be\\nMarketing, rather than being an expense, is an investment on future income. Companies that like to have a constant flow of business market routinely‚Äîit‚Äôs a regular action, rather than a ‚Äúone and done‚Äù activity. But quality marketing is not free. It costs time, money, or both.\\nToday, the Internet makes it easy for small to medium-size businesses to find cost-effective marketing methods for any budget. But you may still discover that you‚Äôve spent more some months than you‚Äôd set aside.\\nIn such a case, just jockey what‚Äôs been most effective against what‚Äôs most affordable. If need be, hold off on the more expensive marketing methods until the less costly ones start producing sufficient income.\\nFor as little as $0.59 per each, including postage, full-color postcards are a ridiculously good marketing value, and you can create you own right now, online, and even target a new batch of prospects to mail them to by logging in to www.prospectsplus.com/pei.\\nOr, if designing a postcard is not in your ‚Äúplans,‚Äù\\xa0you can turn it over to our design and marketing pros at Opportunity Knocks at 1 (866) 319-7109. Tell them about your business and your goals and they design and target a postcard that gets you there.\\nThe post The Easiest 5-Step Marketing Plan‚Ä¶Ever! appeared first on Direct Mail Marketing News.',\n",

It will wash over them like the warmth you feel when you step out into the sunlight. For some, the realization will take their breath away for a moment. Time might even feel as if it‚Äôs standing still. These people have reached that critical point when they could see the truth in this information and finally know what they need to do to keep their companies growing.\\nIt sounds a bit mystical, doesn‚Äôt it?\\nIt is.\\nThe Ideal Circumstances\\nAfter that big build-up, we fear we may disappoint a few people with what we‚Äôre about to say, but here it is: If your current postcard is not performing very well, this information won‚Äôt do much for you.\\nFirst, it‚Äôs a necessary circumstance that you mail our your postcards regularly and repeatedly; you‚Äôre not expecting marketing miracles on one mailing per year.\\nBut if you‚Äôre sending out a substantial number of cards every week or month and your ROI is for the dogs, this information won‚Äôt change\\xa0 your situation appreciably.\\nIf you can at the very least say that your current postcard is producing ‚Äúnot great, but acceptable ROI,‚Äù then you‚Äôre still in a great position.\\nAnd if your card is doing great, you‚Äôre in the ideal circumstances under which to benefit from the information which we‚Äôre going to get into‚Ä¶\\n‚Ä¶Right now.\\nHere it comes: mail out twice as many cards as you‚Äôre currently mailing.\\n(Trust us, we hear those eyes rolling‚Ä¶)\\nThis is the concept of scaling up: your current card produces a certain amount of ROI. Sending out more of it will produce more income.\\nYes, it is as easy as that.\\nThis is one of the most difficult points for us to get people to think with. No offense, but it‚Äôs almost too simple a concept for some business owners to accept: the more marketing communications you mail out, the more response‚Äîleads, income, etc.‚Äîyou get.\\n‚ÄúBut We Already Mail to Our Entire List‚Ä¶‚Äù\\nThere are plenty more people out there who are just like your current customers.\\nThey need and want your product or service. You can use Neighborhood Radius Marketing\\xa0to reach more of them in your geographic are. Or take advantage of Big Data with a service like Nielsen Prizm Data to reach more prospects\\xa0who think and feel the same way as your ideal customer, regardless of location.\\nThe Alternative\\nYou could try and squeeze more response out the same-sized mailing by tweaking the design of your current card and doing endless rounds of A-B testing of the headline, the image, the call to action.\\nAnd it‚Äôs true: A-B testing is valid and can make a huge difference in your ROI but it‚Äôs not fast and it‚Äôs not easy. (Remember, the title of this post is ‚ÄúThe Fastest, Easiest Way to 2x, 3x‚ÄîEven 4x Your Postcard Marketing Results,‚Äù okay?)\\nTweaking and testing (or hiring a designer with experience in your industry) is for those people whose card is producing lousy, embarrassingly low ROI.\\n‚ÄúOf Course You Guys Would Say That‚Ä¶\\n‚Ä¶you‚Äôre in the postcard business.‚Äù We were waiting for someone to bring that up. True, we are in the postcard marketing business but that doesn‚Äôt mean what we‚Äôre saying isn‚Äôt true.\\nAll you have to do to prove it to yourself is try it and see. We‚Äôd be shocked if you didn‚Äôt see a notable increase in ROI, commensurate with your increase in output.\\nSo, if you‚Äôve got a card that producing acceptable results and you‚Äôre in a hurry to expand your company, take the fast and easy route: double, triple or quadruple the number of postcards you‚Äôre now sending. The more you marketing postcards you send out, the more response, leads, and income you get.\\nWhen you log on to www.prospectsplus.com/pei, you can duplicate your existing design and get access to Neighborhood Radius Marketing and Nielsen Prizm, to expand your mailing list.

       " 'via http://bit.ly/2F3e9VJ Whether you‚Äôve only marketed your business digitally or never marketed at all, you will eventually ask yourself the question (if you haven‚Äôt already), ‚ÄúAre paid online ads and email enough?‚Äù\\nYou probably don‚Äôt click on every single ad you see when you‚Äôre online, to you? And you probably don‚Äôt open every email that every marketer sends you, right? (We certainly thank you for opening this one.)\\nYour prospects probably aren‚Äôt much different than you. They might even make liberal use of a spam folder and ad-blocking software.\\nIt‚Äôs hard to be absolutely sure, unless they somehow contact you and move the sales cycle ahead.\\nBut one thing‚Äôs for sure: postal mailboxes don‚Äôt have spam filters or pop-up blockers, so direct mail has a much higher degree of certainty of receipt; you can be sure that your prospect is seeing your promotion.\\nAnd it doesn‚Äôt stop there. It‚Äôs been scientifically proven that you get a much higher rate of response with direct mail.\\xa0A U.S. Postal Service-sponsored study which found that postcards generate a more significant and lasting effect than digital marketing methods: 79% of recipients respond immediately, as opposed only 45% of email recipients.\\nWe could toss out more pro-direct mail stats but let‚Äôs get on to the reason you began reading‚Äîseven great ideas for your first postcard campaign:\\n1.) The Introducer\\nThis is for new businesses or a new location or office. It‚Äôs the ‚ÄúHey, here we are!‚Äù card. An introduction postcard may be the first exposure a prospect has of you, so it should be straightforward about what you do, where you located and how your prospect benefits from choosing you. And even though it‚Äôs just supposed to be an introduction, you do want them to respond, right? So remember to present an offer.\\n2.) Dollars Off\\nWhether you‚Äôre trying to win back customers who‚Äôve gone astray or just generate more business from existing customers, you can‚Äôt lose with a discount offer. But according to one study, you‚Äôll win more if you express your discount in dollars, rather than in a percentage. Specifically, dollar amounts (‚ÄúGet $1 off,‚Äù ‚ÄúTake $50 of your next order,‚Äù ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs $20!‚Äù etc.) were consistently found to perform twice as well as a percentage discount.\\n3.) Thank You!\\nAccording to a 2014 survey, 53% of U.S. consumers will take their business elsewhere when they feel unappreciated, taken for granted.\\nYou‚Äôre a customer too, so you know how it feels. Don‚Äôt be that guy (or girl). Remember to send a direct mail thank you note when customers make a significant purchase or reach a new customer milestone.\\n4.) Rewards Program\\nThink of a rewards program postcard as being a Dollars Off-Thank You! combo. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be overly complicated. Decide what qualifies a customer for a reward (discount, something free, etc.) and, if you‚Äôre using marketing automation, you can set it up to recognize the signals and trigger a new card informing of their discount or freebie.\\n5.) The Happy Holiday Postcard\\nDuring Christmas and New Years, people anticipate receiving cards in the mail from family and friends. All this attention on the mailbox set up the perfect conditions to send out your own warm holiday greeting. And definitely put the emphasis on the greeting. Wish them a wonderful holiday. Thank them for their business. And then, almost as an afterthought, present them with an irresistible offer or holiday discount.\\nDid this post give you some ideas for your first (or next) postcard campaign?

You can launch a re-engagement campaign regardless.\\nYou might never find out exactly why a customer churned‚Äîbut that shouldn‚Äôt stop you from making an effort to win them back with a re-engagement campaign.\\nRe-Engagement Basics\\nA re-engagement campaign is a two-step process:\\nIdentify when a customer has churned\\nCreate and launch offers to win them back\\nChurn is more obvious in some kinds of businesses (the customer cancels their membership, for instance) so the first thing you‚Äôve got to do is define what churn is for your business. Is it when they haven‚Äôt opened your last six emails? Last twelve? Haven‚Äôt made a purchase in six months? A year?\\nIf you monitor your marketing with any sort of modern marketing automation system, once you‚Äôve defined churn, you should easily be able to identify when it happens and set up an automated sequence to respond to it.\\nYour campaign can‚Äôt be anything as blunt as ‚ÄúBaby, come back!‚Äù (Then again, for some kinds of businesses‚Äîperhaps a music streaming service‚Äîit might work.) Like any effective marketing piece, your re-engagement campaign has to have an irresistible offer‚Ä¶something like these:\\n‚ÄúEnjoy 25% off your next order for the next seven days‚Äù\\n‚ÄúGet a free (product, add-on, etc.) with your next purchase‚Äù\\n‚ÄúNow! Pay as you go (or another kind of pricing option that might better suit their needs)‚Äù\\nWhile you will likely have some decent response to your first email, plan on multiple emails over a several-month period. Reason: One 2014 study of re-engagement campaigns showed that 25% of disengaged customers continued to open and read emails for 300 days after the first re-engagement message.\\nThis Puts the Oomph in Your Re-Engagement Campaign\\nThe problem with relying on email alone when conducting a re-engagement campaign is that not all churns will still be active email subscribers.\\nFor some, you will have been marked as spam. Others will have unsubscribed. Maybe they closed out that particular email account. (A recent forecast noted that the majority of email users have multiple email accounts.)\\nSo if you‚Äôre not totally certain you‚Äôre reaching their in-box, go for their mailbox.

And somebody finding your postcard in their mailbox is going to devote only so much time to it, so you can‚Äôt expect them to read a lot of copy.\\nPostcard campaigns with a single value proposition do much better than campaigns that try to cram in too much information and too many messages. Solution: hit ‚Äôem with a single headline message that communicates your unique value proposition.\\nTestimonials\\nWhy wrack your brain trying to come up with ‚Äúcreative‚Äù copy if you already have some great testimonials? Prospects and customers don‚Äôt always trust what you have to say about your business. Of course you think you‚Äôre wonderful, valuable, better than the rest. They put much more faith in a rave review from someone who has paid for your services. They identify with the customer.\\nLet your delighted customers speak for you.\\nA Great Image\\nDid you ever get a postcard from a friend or family member who was on vacation? Was the front of the card full of text you had to read to find out about the exotic or exciting locale they sent it from?\\nOf course not; it had a color photo of a sunny beach or a luxury hotel or a serene countryside. The picture was the message.\\nPostcards‚Äîeven marketing postcards‚Äîare no different. They‚Äôre primarily visual with a little bit of text. So choose one or two images that speak for your product or service. This is not difficult. You don‚Äôt need an art degree. In fact, in our experience, it‚Äôs the people who are not photography buffs that pick the most effective photos for their marketing efforts.\\nFor instance, if you do landscaping or painting or cosmetic dentistry, use before-and-after photos. If you do auto repair or plumbing or HVAC, show happy people in their car or home. Pictures of smiling, satisfied people are very effective in marketing (Your customers might even be willing to give you a picture of themselves to use with their testimonial, so ask.).\\nIf you don‚Äôt have photos of your own, use stock images, like the kind you can get by subscribing to ShutterStock or a donation-based service like Pixabay.\\nBuy Now\\nGive your customers and prospects a reason to buy now by putting a deadline on the offer you‚Äôre presenting.\\nPeople understand deadlines. And because so many of them come with penalties (late fees, etc.), it is possible that people identify any deadline with a penalty. So when you give them a deadline for your offer, they feel they must heed it or they will lose out (penalty).\\nIf you don‚Äôt, then people lose the card or cover it up with other things they tack to the fridge door. There‚Äôs no sense of urgency, so they forget about it.\\nSo give them a deadline (‚ÄúOffer good until [date],‚Äù\\xa0‚ÄúSupplies limited‚Ä¶,‚Äù etc.). It will compel them to buy now!\\nAnd that is all there is to it‚Äîfour skills: (1) identify a value proposition, (2) gather testimonials, (3) choose images that tell your story, and (4) set a deadline.\\nSo rather than agonizing about ‚Äúcreative‚Äù or ‚Äúart,‚Äù for hours on end, you can get your postcard campaign designed and out the door and get back to the rest of your life and your business.\\nIn fact, you can do all of this from your desktop, right now, by logging on to www.prospectsplus.com/pei. There you will find customizable postcard templates and list-building tools, and you can even handle the mailing with a few mouse clicks.\\nOr call Opportunity Knocks at 1 (866) 319-7109.

       " 'via http://bit.ly/2G2cEIv\\nDo you know that old saying, ‚ÄúThe only certainties in life are death and taxes‚Äù? While that may be true for all of us, businesses that market to consumers have a couple of additional certainties:\\nCustomers and prospects look for the easiest excuse to discard your direct mail postcard without engaging with it.\\nYou will always need to do all you can to ensure that your postcard promotions rise above the ‚Äústatic‚Äù created by the majority of other direct mail advertisers.\\nIf you understand and fully apply the following four points to your future promotions, you will dramatically increase response, conversion, and customer goodwill (which leads to more response and conversion).\\n1.) Choose and use current, vibrant imagery.\\nWhen you use photos or graphic elements that are dull‚Äîthe same or similar to things customers have seen a thousand times‚Äîyour campaign becomes just another singer in the ‚Äústatic choir‚Äù created by all the other dull marketing efforts out there.\\nIn the entertainment business, it‚Äôs understood that every story has already been. It‚Äôs never a matter of telling a new story but of how to tell the same kinds of stories in the most interesting way.\\nSo yes, you‚Äôve got to try a bit harder to find (or create) photographic images or graphics that feel fresh and new.\\nAnd so it is with your images.\\nDo this: Google ‚Äúfreshest direct marketing postcard designs‚Äù or similar wording to see what‚Äôs catching peoples‚Äô eyes right now. You can also log on to www.prospectsplus.com/pei and sample our customizable design templates, which we keep very fresh indeed.\\n2.) Reach for the Heart, Not the Mind.\\nA successful promotional postcard is one that causes your customer/prospect to feel something‚Äîand emotional reaction. If you card demands of them to read, think, compare, etc., it‚Äôs headed for the recycle bin.\\nWhat is the real human benefit that your product or service delivers. Ask yourself how it does one or more of the following:\\nMake life (or one of life‚Äôs aspects) easier\\nMake the future more secure\\nPut them in more control\\nMake them better than average\\nMake them healthier, smarter, or more attractive\\nBrainstorm on this and come up with all the different ways. Then brainstorm again on ways to express these benefits. Create headlines, taglines, subject lines that express this.\\nDo this: Ask some of your current customers why they choose you over your competition. They will tell you in terms of the real human benefit, the emotional reasons. Listen to their words and take notes. They just might give you a testimonial that you can use as the headline for your next campaign.\\n3.) Seek to Develop Interest, Not Close a Sale.\\nA postcard is not a sales letter or an email. While it‚Äôs true that ‚Äúthe more you tell, the more you sell,‚Äù a postcard simply does not have the necessary space for lists of benefits and features or numerous calls to action or the other elements of effective direct response copy.\\nSo don‚Äôt approach your postcard design as it it‚Äôs just a smaller version of an email or letter.\\nInstead, say just enough with your to create intrigue and generate interest for the reader‚Ä¶and make sure to include your contact information.\\n4.) Keep Your Offer Simple and Don‚Äôt Push It Too Hard\\nWhile you must have an offer\\xa0always remember these two things:\\nKeep your offer simple\\nYou don‚Äôt have to make the offer the central focus of your postcard\\nLike we mentioned in #2 above, do your best to not make people have to read a lot or have to calculate or compare. Present one offer, such as giving them something for free. People understand ‚ÄúTwo for one entrees‚Äù or ‚ÄúSeventh car wash free.‚Äù\\nAnd also as we began to say in #2 above, put most of your postcard design effort into pushing the core benefit of your product or service. Appeal to your customer‚Äôs self-interest. Make the offer seem offhand, an afterthought. Put it on the back of the card.\\nTry these four things on your next postcard campaign and remember to let us know how it went for you.\\nAnd you can put these four points to work right now by logging on to www.prospectsplus.com/pei, where you‚Äôll find those fresh design templates we mentioned and a lot more, including targeted list-building and mailing services, all from your computer or tablet.\\nYou can also get your postcard created by marketing and design experts who‚Äôve produced thousands of successful campaigns for businesses just like yours.

       " 'via http://bit.ly/2Doxujk We discussed marketing to millennials a couple times last year‚Äîmostly on the topic of how, against most marketer‚Äôs assumptions, millennials like and respond to direct mail.\\nAs important as it is to know how to market to the younger generation, the plain fact is that, when it comes to having money to spend, the baby boomers are still the largest and most powerful age demographic.\\nSo, let‚Äôs review a few things about marketing to them, shall we?\\nThe Numbers\\nOver the next 10 years, nearly 70 million boomers will be retirement age. This is a largely affluent generation who will have plenty of free time to shop and discretionary income to spend. (Oh, and did we mention that, according to Forbes, they will inherit nearly $13 trillion between now and 2037?)\\nNo matter what industry or profession you‚Äôre in, it‚Äôs likely that it‚Äôs needed or wanted or might appeal to this generation. So here‚Äôs five things to keep in mind when promoting your product/service to them:\\n1.) They Don‚Äôt Consider Themselves Old\\nThis is the generation that experienced Beatlemania, youth culture, the hippies. They were raised on rock and roll but retirement to this crew doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúrocking chair.‚Äù\\nBaby boomers will use their golden years to do all the stuff they couldn‚Äôt do while they were raising families: travel to exotic locales and have adventures. So don‚Äôt assume that such things won‚Äôt appeal to them. You just need to present it in a way that appeals to them‚Äîwhich may be different than how you would present it to a younger demographic.\\n2.) They Appreciate Quality Marketing Copy\\nBoomers like to read. But they largely don‚Äôt dig trendy slang, web abbreviations, acronyms, etc. (OMG! LOL!) So write proper copy. And don‚Äôt skimp. This generation is used to traditional direct mail, such as long-copy sales letters and the like. Though postcards provide limited space, you can still fill the back side of your card with sufficient copy.\\nAnother thing is to play it safe with conventional sales copy‚Äîno hype, no foul language, nothing overly clever or cute. Address any possible objections they might raise‚Äîthis goes not only for your direct mail but also for websites, brochures, and other marketing pieces.\\n3.) Don‚Äôt Rush ‚ÄòEm\\nGenerally speaking, before a boomer makes a purchase, they will do their research. This includes familiarizing themselves with the product or service; talking to others who‚Äôve used it or a competing brand; compare specs, check reviews, and the like. This generation has money but many are on a fix income, so purchases are viewed as investments. In short, they won‚Äôt be rushed into a purchase, so your best strategy (as detailed in point #2) is to give them plenty of information and content. Shoot for gaining their trust in your brand. When they get to that point, they are on the threshold of a close.\\n4.) Get Personal\\nThey‚Äôre retired. They are not in any hurry. They have plenty of free time and tend to enjoy longer interactions with people‚Äîfamily, friends and, yes, even salespeople. So, if you‚Äôre marketing to this age demographic, don‚Äôt be in a hurry. Rather, be willing, ready, and able to invest time in them. It‚Äôs the flipside of #3 above. You will likely find a willing set of ears, interested in hearing what you have to say about how your product or service can benefit them.\\n5.) Baby Boomers Aren‚Äôt Afraid of Technology\\nThe younger generations are often identified as the tech savvy ones but boomers are no less savvy. They may not have had smartphones in their cribs but they‚Äôve lived through the progression of black and white TV to color, the advent of stereo sound, cordless telephones, VHS players, CDs‚Ä¶you get the idea. They are not fazed by more recent technology. More than 90% of boomers use email and search engines, and make purchases online. Because they are the fastest-growing age group on Facebook, you can successfully bolster your direct mail efforts with Facebook ads; they‚Äôll see it.\\nNow that you know more about marketing to boomers, you can put that knowledge to work on your next postcard campaign, which you can design, print and mail, all from the comfort of your desktop, by logging on to www.prospectsplus.com/pei.\\nOr call Opportunity Knocks at 1 (866) 319-7109. Tell our design and marketing pros what you need and want and we‚Äôll handle everything from design, to generating a targeted list, and even the mailing. You‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúBoom. That was easy.‚Äù\\nThe post Baby Boomer Marketing: 5 Most Overlooked Secrets appeared first on Direct Mail Marketing News.',\n",

       " 'New Post has been published on http://growyourtwitternetwork.hol.es/5-ways-to-sell-with-social-media/index.html5 Ways to Sell With Social MediaJim Belosic\\nBy Jim BelosicPublished September 19, 2013 External image\\n\\nExternal imageDo you want to convert your fans and followers into paying customers?\\nAre your social activities working?\\nIn this article I‚Äôll show you 5 simple ways to tweak your social media updates for better sales conversion.\\nSome social media updates can go further toward bringing in sales than others. And they can do this without detracting from the spirit of social media.\\nExternal imageSome social media updates can help with sales more than others. Image source: iStockPhoto.\\n#1: Incorporate a Clear Call to Action\\nYour customers and fans visit your social media pages for a variety of reasons, but generally speaking, they want to do something or learn something.\\nSome people are looking for information about your company, some are looking for details about products and services, some want access to special deals and coupons, some want to see if you have any contests or promotions running and some may be looking for expert tips and how-to tricks.\\nIf you don‚Äôt give them what they‚Äôre after, they won‚Äôt return. Use status updates to give them what they want and what you want: a sale.\\nPost calls to action like ‚ÄúClick here for a Facebook fan exclusive coupon,‚Äù or ‚ÄúEnter to win‚Ä¶‚Äù\\nHere you see how Target offers daily deals on Twitter.\\nExternal imageTarget has a Twitter account where followers can see deals the retailer has in stores.\\nBut remember to stay true to the 70-20-10 rule: 70 percent of your page‚Äôs content should be information that‚Äôs valuable and relevant to your fans; 20 percent should be content that comes from other people and 10 percent should be promotional.\\nOnce you know why your audience wants to interact with you on social media, be sure to give them the types of information they‚Äôre looking for.\\n#2: Convey a Sense of Urgency\\nDue to the ticker-tape nature of most social media platforms, you have a very limited amount of time to catch the attention of your customers/fans/followers. If they see an update with verbiage that compels them to ‚Äúact now,‚Äù you win.\\nUsing words like ‚ÄúFor a limited time‚Äù or ‚ÄúOn sale this week‚Äù or ‚ÄúOwn it first‚Äù will catch the eye of your visitors.\\nYou can also offer incentives for booking or buying immediately instead of later. Depending on your business, you could waive shipping fees, offer an extra week of your service or even a buy-one/get-one, etc. Ideally, post different time-sensitive offers on different networks.\\nFor example, ‚ÄúThe next 10 people who retweet this will receive 10% off their next purchase.‚Äù On Facebook you could use an app to make an offer like, ‚ÄúThe first 10 people to share this on Facebook get $25 off a $50 purchase,‚Äù and so on.\\nHere, Chili‚Äôs uses their Facebook cover photo to connect and offer a deal.\\nExternal imageChili‚Äôs uses their cover photo to announce a limited-time offer.\\nThis is one way to use the instant nature of social media to your advantage.\\n#3: Offer Followers and Fans Exclusive Deals\\nThis idea is similar to the previous one, but you want to make sure that your fans know the deals you‚Äôre offering are for fans of a particular network only.\\nTo grow your following on a variety of networks and inspire loyalty, offer deals that are exclusive to each network.\\nKate Spade New York always has something special cookin‚Äô for their Facebook fans. Periodically offering special deals is a great tactic for a business that wants to keep its fans coming back again and again. And doesn‚Äôt every business want that?\\nExternal imageKate Spade New York offers Facebook fans exclusive deals and coupons on a regular basis. It keeps them coming back again and again.\\nThis is a great way to reach out to specific audiences within your social media strategy.\\n#4: Encourage Sharing\\nIt never hurts to ask your fans and followers to retweet, repin or share. Ideally you‚Äôre offering such a great deal that your fans and followers will want to share it anyway, but a little nudge is okay.\\nIf your update is about a Facebook contest, you can even let your followers know that if they share the news about your contest, they‚Äôll get an extra chance (or chances) to win.\\nNational Builder Supply uses Pinterest to give fans a chance to win a chandelier.\\nExternal imageNational Builder Supply gives fans a chance to win a new chandelier by repinning their contest image on Pinterest.\\nWhen you ask your audience to interact with your content, they‚Äôre more likely to do it.\\n#5: Keep All of Your Social Media Profiles Current\\nWhen potential customers land on your various social pages, they should have a clear idea of what your business/brand is all about. At the very least, go through each of your business‚Äôs social profiles (Facebook, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) once a quarter and make sure all of the information is current, because social networks occasionally change dimensions and other details.\\nFor example, earlier this year Facebook relaxed its rules about using calls to action on cover photos, but many companies haven‚Äôt yet updated their pages to make the most of this space.\\nTip: You can now include price or purchase information on a Facebook cover photo including phrases like ‚Äú40% off this week only‚Äù or ‚ÄúDownload our new eBook here,‚Äù contact information or other calls to action such as ‚ÄúGet it now‚Äù or ‚ÄúTell your friends.‚Äù The main image should also give customers and prospective customers some insights about you.\\nIn this image, Trunk Club tells you everything about what they do right on their Pinterest page.\\nExternal imageThe men‚Äôs personal shopping service Trunk Club has a fantastic Pinterest profile that tells you everything you need to know about what the company does.\\nNever forget to give your social media audience the information they need about your business.\\nOver to You\\nThese are just a few opportunities for you to connect with potential leads for your business. But together with a strategic plan, they can help convert the quality leads your business is looking for.\\nWhat do you think?

goals that you had I do a lot of the same things that Joshua does on his Facebook page I post very I‚Äôm an open book I post the trades that I‚Äôm looking to get into I‚Äôll post trades that updates and trades that I posted and all that good stuff and I‚Äôm gonna go into a little bit of that today over the next 10-15 minutes but I want to start out with a trade setup that Joshua was looking at yesterday and in his video yesterday and this actually couples on top of what I was talking about yesterday also is the pound Aussie drop and Joshua was talking about the fact that we were in a down a be on a daily basis he was he was talking about how his targets were at much lower levels near almost the two levels I think it was a 2.04 I believe somewhere in there is his overall target and essentially he has been looking for shorting opportunities in the pound Aussie and here‚Äôs the thing he‚Äôs been looking for shorting opportunity in the pound Aussie most of you should know this there you go two zero zero five zero thank you for that so he‚Äôs been looking for shorting opportunities in the pound Aussie and he‚Äôs probably the only person that I know that‚Äôs been working for this for almost eight hundred pips down now he hasn‚Äôt just blindly shorted this what he‚Äôs been looking to do and he‚Äôs taught many many times on this if we‚Äôre looking for shorting opportunities that‚Äôs great but we have to have a logical systematic reason to get into those trades right so what we look for is we look for high prices too short at that‚Äôs exactly what he was looking for yesterday so what happened here when we started this down sequence we hit our extension we hit our six one eight extension right here we put a new AV boundary in he went over this yesterday and then price rallies up and it goes into what we call the push zone this is what market traders is to the chief calls the push zone it‚Äôs in that push zone in a down a be boundary we‚Äôre still looking for ultimately our target which is you know thousands of pip low pips lower then what we want to do is we want to go to the shorter timeframe and pinpoint our entries and that‚Äôs exactly what Josh did did anybody was anybody able to catch Josh‚Äôs video yesterday and he‚Äôs kind of been on this team for a while was anybody typing a wire yes in the chat box if you were able to catch Josh‚Äôs get a lot of yeses excellent awesome these are the type of opportunities and this is actually well the main reasons why I‚Äôm with market traders Institute right now is because these guys are the real deal they put themselves out there and they don‚Äôt willy nilly they actually call out trade Joshua was on 24 hours ago calling this looking at this consolidation that‚Äôs happened in the pound Aussie and he had two scenarios had two scenarios he had a scenario where if it knows up here he wants to short up in this upper end of this this consolidation range or he wanted to wait for a breakout if he everybody remembers wait for a breakout awesome Andre says he‚Äôs up two hundred pips so far and I hope people are making some money because this trade is awesome what he was looking for is a breakout of this consolidation look what happened right here it was basically happening almost as he was talking about breakout of this consolidation or later on in the day he had a webinar that he was presenting on that was breaking out and then he wanted to establish a new lower low right establish a lower low from this consolidation and then retraced back into or near that area to short and then take it on the short side and if you look here spot-on you can‚Äôt you almost can‚Äôt get better analysis tonight it‚Äôs really amazing and Jeanne said yeah up 147 pips on we have 200 pips this is the kind of these are the kind of trades we bring and that‚Äôs absolutely phenomenal now there‚Äôs going to be another shorting opportunity that presents itself over time right now I don‚Äôt think that there‚Äôs anything that I would jump on at this exact point there is something setting up that is Australian type of focused in the Aussie dollar that I‚Äôm going to talk about but if we look here at our hour-long AV boundaries we did hit our extension we put our new ABN if for those that have been around for those that understand market traders Institute‚Äôs concepts and education you should know that the next next most logical directional move is at least to the 3a ‚Äì retracement that make sense to everybody so in this move we‚Äôve got if you‚Äôre up 200 plus pips ultimately you‚Äôve got a lot of profit potential all the way down to you know another thousand pips lower now 1,400 pips lower but you don‚Äôt just need to blindly hold these if this is the case this is the scenario and there may be some reversal short-term reversals happening here you may see a little bit of a rally which is fine that‚Äôll help us get establish another short position because what do we know about prior support this was prior support what does that become it becomes resistance so what I‚Äôm looking for and this hasn‚Äôt played out quite yet but what I‚Äôm looking for is a retracement of this current a B down and I‚Äôm looking in this area right here essentially right at this key pivot low there which is right around the 382 retracement so between the 215 and 215 I‚Äôd say about 215 exactly all the way up to about almost 216 so within this about a hundred pip range what I want to see is I want to see a short term I‚Äôll kind of draw this out here what I want to see is I want to see a retracement and then I want to see a short-term reversal pattern and then a break and then that will help me establish my short position so for now I am actually not in this trade I‚Äôm waiting for that retracement back up and then I‚Äôm gonna look to tag off and get short again right around this to 1550 between to 15 15 to 16 area and I‚Äôm probably going to target this six one eight extension all the way down to 211 and then I want to get out lock in my profits and look for another error to short it this is going to be a theme that that plays out probably over the next couple months over the next few months is this is a theme that‚Äôs going to play out yeah we you can use a trend line break absolutely Susu asks what about a trend line break absolutely perfect so what you could do is look at this current trend line that‚Äôs kind of informing right here what I would look for is look for a retracement first look for a 3/8 to retracement first I think it will probably hold this trendline and then much like this pattern that I think is gonna play out wait for that trend line to break then X then then get in and target that D extension does that make sense to everybody so let me type that out real quick so look for retracement into into 0.38 ‚Äì so I‚Äôm gonna say between essentially between 2:15 and 2:16 right in there and then enter short on a bearish trend trend line break break target to 1185 which is the one six one eight extension so that‚Äôs kind of if you‚Äôre not in this trade if you already have your plan already planned out then stick with what with your original plan if you don‚Äôt and just know that you might go through you know you might go through a 50 60 70 pips of drawdown here or you might give some of that profit back if you if you stay in this trade right now I‚Äôm gonna look to enter as we retrace back up into this into this retracement and then look to enter on a trend line break my stop is going to be above the u-turn so it‚Äôs gonna be 10 pips above the u-turn so stop 10 pips above u-turn okay so if that‚Äôs the case what I‚Äôm looking at here is let‚Äôs say we get our u-turn right here get our trend line break we‚Äôre looking at probably let‚Äôs say about a 50 pips top and a about a 300 to 350 pip target that makes sense so if everybody go ahead and and open up your GoToWebinar click on the little flower blue flower button and take a picture of this this is kind of the setup that I‚Äôm looking for if you‚Äôre already in it you already have a plan that‚Äôs great it‚Äôs working out well just know I think we could see some a little bit of a retracement of this prior of this last a me down okay excellent so I‚Äôm going to move on real quick here to the Aussie dollar this is a trade that I posted that I talked about very very similar to what Josh is planning was planning out on the pound Aussie long story short everybody should realize the thesis and the the idea on the short pound I‚Äôm sorry yeah the short in the pound Aussie and the long opportunity that I look for in the Aussie dollar was Australian strength and so that‚Äôs that‚Äôs really what I was looking for here and that‚Äôs what Josh was looking for so this was an opportunity that I that I that I called out got long at 70 110 and I actually got long right at the open for the week early Sunday early Sunday night for my case I‚Äôm in Minnesota Central Time my target is 7660 but here‚Äôs the thing what I said is no we cannot we cannot just ignore the 7210 and I posted this as you can see is November first was Sunday night we can‚Äôt ignore the 7210 area so what I was planning to do and I did I dropped half of my position let me go to there one second here let me go to the Aussie dollar I dropped half of my position at seventy two ten and now I‚Äôm looking to get back in the reason why I dropped half of my position at 7210 was simply because that was as my chart loads that was the four hour and I explained this in I tried I try to go into these are the type of trades I posted my Facebook page so you know I try to go into as much detail as I can but that was the four hour 3 8 2 retracement so what I mean by that is this current a me down right here was a 4-hour 3 2 retracement that was also a key level and typing a wire yes in the chat box a few quarts if you can see how that was a key historical psychological level of support resistance we broke we knife through there I call that a knifing pivot essentially knifing through the pivot we then come back up doesn‚Äôt surprise me price comes back up to test so now what Tyson now what are you doing that‚Äôs great you get so you you drop half of your position and now you‚Äôre looking now here‚Äôs my plan I still hold half my position I‚Äôm looking to re-enter in the full-size position as we retrace back down to my overall target whoops to my overall target of 7660 so here‚Äôs my plan you get rid of all this drawing here and this okay so we are starting to see or we actually are forming a fairly decent crowd pattern here and what I‚Äôm looking for is I‚Äôm looking for a retracement of the four-hour fibonacci sequence so what that looks like is we actually just hit our extension our four-hour extension this current a B just fulfilled does everybody see that just fulfilled which means we‚Äôre gonna put in our new once we get a new fractal we‚Äôre actually gonna put in a new a B and that new a B is going to probably look like that buddy see that it‚Äôs probably going to look like that this is probably going to be the true fractal high that‚Äôs going to be the low we‚Äôre going to retrace back down probably retrace back down into a prior area of resistance which will become support is this a prior area of resistance can everybody see that yes okay excellent well that‚Äôs right at or right near our six one eight retracement this is where I‚Äôm looking to re-enter and now what I‚Äôm looking for is I‚Äôm looking for price to retrace back down then put in a short term I‚Äôll go to a probably a 15 minute chart look for a short-term reversal re-enter the other half position then I‚Äôm going to plan on riding it all the way to my target of 76 60 but these two trades the pound Aussie called out by Joshua Martinez and the Aussie dollar if you actually look at and look at the details of these trades I‚Äôm not sure if you can get better analysis than those two I got a pat ourselves on the back but those are the type of trades that we try to post on a daily basis those are the type of trades that I‚Äôm gonna try to bring to you tomorrow try bring the next day and I looked for opportunities so for the let‚Äôs recap real quick for the Aussie dollar there‚Äôs nothing I would get into right now wait for a retracement down into the 71 53 area or seven 150 area look for a short-term reversal and look to get long and I‚Äôm gonna ride this thing I think it‚Äôs got a lot of profit potential to 7660 it‚Äôs got plenty of profit I‚Äôm probably as we breakout above this this high that we just put in I‚Äôm probably gonna move my stop up but I‚Äôm gonna keep my stop where it‚Äôs at originally which is 69 third and then in the pound Aussie as we just explained my plan here is and I‚Äôm not in this trade so this would be my plan I think it‚Äôs gonna ride this trendline it‚Äôs gonna go back up into its retracement or up into the push zone and then I‚Äôm gonna look for a trend line break and I‚Äôm gonna target the six-month extension hopefully everybody hopefully that makes sense to everybody I thank you guys for your time that is the the update video today we will post the link for tomorrow‚Äôs video please go like me on facebook facebook.com backslash ty the trader and let‚Äôs make it a great day thanks for everybody‚Äôs time you\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\nGlobal Women Health Diagnostics Market Research and Analysis 2015-2022\\n\\n‚ÄúWOMEN HEALTH FROM WOMB TO TOMB‚ÄùWomen across the globe have a\\nvery special place in the growth of family and nation. A mother is responsible\\nfor the birth of a child, and without her, there is no life. According to UN,\\nthe total number of women population across the globe was around 3.74 billion\\nin 2017 and this number is anticipated to grow to 4.05 billion in 2025. The\\nstatus of women directly reflects the health status of any nation. Owing to\\ndeteriorating quality of life, women‚Äôs health has become a major concern among\\nthe nations. Disease and disorders of the female reproductive system threaten\\nthe physical and emotional health of women globally. The common reproductive disorders\\nthat occur in women aged 41 to 60 are menopause, infections of reproductive\\ntract and so on. In addition, women face various chronic disease such as breast\\ncancer, lack of fertility, low bone mass (osteoporosis), STDs such as HIV,\\nherpes and many more. Getting proper diagnosis for a women is the duty of government\\nand family. Diagnosis and screening of such diseases may save millions of lives\\nglobally. Diagnosis and screening for women include MRI, mammography, lab-based\\ntesting, and blood tests. There is huge opportunity for diagnostic device\\nmanufacturers and investors in the global women health diagnostic market.‚ÄúWOMEN HEALTH IS ONE OF THE WHO‚ÄôS HIGHEST PRIORITIES‚ÄùMany women lose their lives due\\nto lack of access to medical treatment such as diagnosis and screening of chronic\\nlife threatening diseases. One of the major health related problems faced by\\nwomen is pregnancy and fertility issues. There are more than 1 billion pregnant\\nwomen across the globe and diagnosis tests such as lab-based testing, fertility\\nmonitors, and pregnancy testing and ovulation prediction kits are performed. To\\ndiagnose pregnancy related issues, women have many test kits, through which one\\ncan perform the test at home. Such test kits cost very low around $0.50 and are\\neasily available online or at over the counter stores.Many government organizations are\\npouring efforts on women diagnosis and screening to prevent women from major\\noutbreaks. For instance, for screening of cervical cancer, American cancer\\nsociety suggests that a woman should have PAP smear test every two years,\\nstarting at age 21. There are many government organizations that are supporting\\nwomen health such as Office on Women Health, Center For Women Policy Studies,\\nGynecologic Cancer Foundation and so on. These government organizations support\\nwomen for various disease outbreaks such as breast cancer, cervical cancer,\\nosteoporosis, and HIVs. Most of these government organizations develop public\\nprivate partnership by joining hands with private diagnostic centers, clinics,\\nhospitals and other healthcare service providers to provide quality of services\\nfor the betterment of women patient pool at an affordable price. CONCLUSIONWomen health diagnosis is a major\\nburden for any government and nation. Favorable regulations for awareness campaigns\\nregarding various chronic disease such as HIV, some cancer, osteoporosis should\\nbe started by the government in low income countries (though there are many\\ncampaign, but the rate of such campaign should be high).In addition, the\\ngovernment and private healthcare providers should offer free or discounted\\ndiagnosis and screening service to women in low income countries. The\\ndiagnostic devices face very strict FDA regulations in the commercialization\\nprocess. These regulations should be smoothened and support to manufacturers\\nshould be provided to ensure maximum utilization of diagnostic products and\\nservices.\\nFor More updated Follow: LinkedIn\\n',\n",

       " 'via http://bit.ly/2uyoMxn You‚Äôve heard of the ‚Äúdopamine effect?‚Äù The ‚Äúexperts‚Äù (psychologists, etc.) say that it‚Äôs what is to blame for addiction‚Äîanything from alcohol to a ‚ÄúLike‚Äù on one‚Äôs Facebook post‚Äîand how people go back to these things over and over, in hope of getting that same pleasurable feeling again.\\nSimply, dopamine is a chemical in the body which is said to affect our emotions, movement and the sensation of pleasure. The theory is that when certain things happen in life, dopamine is released in the brain, and it makes you feel good or it motivates physical activity.\\nThe ‚Äúexperts‚Äù say that the dopamine effect is what‚Äôs behind ‚Äúsmartphone addiction,‚Äù ‚Äúsocial media addiction,‚Äù and ‚Äúvideo game addiction.‚Äù (We suspect that the experts might be addicted to identify new addictions.)\\nThe dopamine effect may or may not be a real thing. For our purposes, it‚Äôs just a handy analogy to describe the feeling of pleasure we experience when we get something we want.\\nPerhaps people just like what they like and so they want more of it. We‚Äôre not sure. But one thing we are sure of is that people don‚Äôt visit their mailboxes everyday because they‚Äôre addicted to getting another bill.\\nAnd most people do check their mailboxes daily. The U.S. Postal Service found that 98.6% of Americans bring their mail in and read it every day.\\nWhy? Perhaps it‚Äôs the same reason that they check Facebook 20 times a day to see if anyone liked or commented on that video they posted of a German Shepherd saying ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù They need that ‚Äúhit‚Äù of attention, recognition, and communication.\\nSo, dopamine or not, there is an addiction problem and it‚Äôs rampant‚Äîa national epidemic.\\nThe only humane thing that a responsible marketer can do is‚Ä¶send more direct mail to people.\\nDirect mail doesn‚Äôt just help promote your business; it makes people feel good, too. It brings them pleasure and happiness.\\n‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì\\nYes, that was all a bit tongue-in-cheek.\\nLook at it this way: Americans are out there, every day, picking up their mail. A recent Postal Service report called ‚ÄúThe Mail Moment‚Äù found that Americans spend up to 30 minutes a day going through their mail and reading it.\\nSo send them something. You‚Äôll make their day, and it‚Äôs an opportunity for your business to truly be seen.\\nSome of our clients are addicted to the flexibility of being able to design and mail postcards wherever there‚Äôs a WiFi connection. Log on to ProspectsPLUS at www.prospectsplus.com/pei, to access our customizable design templates and prospect-targeting tools.\\nOur other clients are addicted to our full-service outlet, Opportunity Knocks.

       " 'via http://bit.ly/2u0oMVK In the dictionary, the word ‚Äúprovoke‚Äù is defined: ‚Äúto stimulate or give rise to a reaction or emotion in someone.‚Äù It‚Äôs usually associated with strong and unwelcome reactions.\\nThe word ‚Äúprovocative‚Äù is defined as ‚Äúcausing annoyance, anger, or another strong reaction‚Äù or ‚Äúarousing sexual desire or interest.‚Äù In either case, it‚Äôs done deliberately.\\nHowever, in direct marketing, being provocative means that your headline is not boring ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù but is more interesting. It gets the reader‚Äôs attention and arouses an emotion. It generates further interest, and gets people talking. The more interest you generate, the more response and, ultimately, the more sales you get.\\nSo, sometimes it pays to be a bit provocative. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:\\nSex?\\nIt‚Äôs been said for some time now that ‚Äúsex sells.‚Äù What does that mean? It can be the use of any allusion to sex in writing or in images, to sell a product:\\nThe toothpaste that promises ‚Äúa whiter, sexier smile and fresh breath‚Äù\\nThe perfume commercial that shows guys noticing the girl when she starts using the fragrance\\nThe online ad for a fitness product that shows young women ogling ripped, middle-aged men\\nOf course, you know your typical customer/prospect best, so you can gauge if using sex is the right approach or if it will alienate people.\\nThough often effective, sex is not the only way to be provocative in your marketing. Anything that causes an emotional reaction is considered provocative.\\nWith a little thought and research, you can tap into ‚Äúprovocative power‚Äù without offending anyone.\\nOne way is to study the covers of Cosmopolitan, Reader‚Äôs Digest, the National Enquirer and similar publications with a marketer‚Äôs eye. These publications‚Äô selling power is fully in the emotion-provoking copy on their covers.\\nA few recent examples:\\n‚ÄúDonald & Melania Fight Back: How They‚Äôll Crush Their Enemies‚Äù\\n‚ÄúThe Bachelor Betrayal: I Made a Huge Mistake‚Ä¶I Had To Take a Risk.‚Äù\\n‚ÄúIs Your House Trying to Kill You?‚Äù\\nConflict, sex, personal relationships, environmental menaces‚Äîthese are all big emotional ‚Äúbuttons‚Äù for people. And there are plenty of milder (but still effective ones). You push them and cause a reaction. The one(s) you use might be broad or they might be more specialized and unique to your audience.\\nStudy the Pro-vokers\\nAlong with starting to pay attention to the provocative value of tabloid and magazine headlines, you could also start looking at and learning from the work of master marketing copywriters, some of whom can be very provocative.\\nAmong these is Gary Halbert. It‚Äôs said that his provocative ‚ÄúCan You Look Younger?‚Äù headline helped propel Vikki Lamotta Cosmetics into a $30 million winner. Among Gary‚Äôs other provocative headlines were ‚ÄúHalf-Dead Cuban Washes Ashore in Miami With Strangest Secret That Can Double The Income of Most Americans!‚Äù (That‚Äôs pretty provocative.)\\nAnother guy to study is Bill Jayme, who wrote winning campaign after winning campaign, starting with his very first direct marketing letter as a copywriter at Time magazine. Among his most famous headlines was now-legendary envelope strapline for a Psychology Today magazine subscription campaign: ‚ÄúDo you close the bathroom door even when you‚Äôre the only one home?‚Äù\\nThese guys were professional provokers (‚Äúpro-vokers‚Äù). Google them and ‚Äúgreatest copywriters‚Äù and study what they wrote. Get a ‚Äúfeel‚Äù for what makes a provocative headline.\\nKeep Your Eyes Open\\nGreat ideas‚Äîprovocative ones that you can adapt for your own marketing campaigns‚Äîare all around. So pay attention. They can be found in the subject lines of marketing emails in your in-box or in the direct mail that you receive. You might see a billboard or‚Ä¶.\\nTake note of headlines that grab you.

       " 'via http://bit.ly/2JvtO7a Though the web is full of marketing ‚Äúrules‚Äù for anyone who cares to Google for such, the 40-40-20 Rule might be one of the most powerful because it‚Äôs also the most simple. It doesn‚Äôt add more activities to your already busy day but helps you focus your current time budget on the factors that bring the biggest returns.\\nThe 40-40-20 Rule represents percentages: 40 percent of your marketing success depends on identifying the right people for your mailing list. The other 40 percent depends upon creating the right offer. The remaining 20 percent is‚Ä¶all the other stuff, like the design elements‚Äîcolors, photos, fonts‚Äîof your postcard. (Certainly these things are important but not as important as the other two.)\\nYou can spend a lot of time on the 20% but the factors that have the most effect on your response and ROI are the list and the offer.\\nHere‚Äôs how to do it:\\n1.) Identify Who Your Customers Are\\nThe world if full of prospects but, unless you‚Äôre fond of wasting tons of money, you don‚Äôt need to reach all prospects; you only need to reach the ones who need or want what you offer‚Äîa percentage of whom will become your customers.\\nSo, instead of ‚Äúspraying and praying‚Äù\\xa0with your marketing, take a more pro-active approach: identify exactly who your ideal customer is, according to demographic factors like these:\\nage range\\nincome\\ngender\\nnumber in household\\nDepending on your product/service, you might want to further refine your ideal customer identify based on psychographic factors\\nYou can learn about all of our mailing list options here.\\nThe more specific you can get about your ideal customer, the more money you will save because you won‚Äôt be sending to ‚Äúalmost‚Äù prospects. And the more response you will get because everyone on your list fits the ideal customer description.\\n2.) Increase Your Warm Leads\\nIt‚Äôs a truism that the best source of future income are the sources of past income‚Äîyour existing customers.\\nNext in line would be those people who have responded to your marketing but have not yet made a purchase. You can gather more of these warm leads by offering prospects a lead magnet, such as a white paper or special report or even a free gift, in exchange for them sending back a business reply card back in the mail or visiting a landing page and taking a short survey. Not everyone will take the bait but many will and those will be your hottest prospects.\\n3.) Personalize Your Offer\\nNotice that both steps #1 and 2 deal with your list? Step 3 is all about your offer.\\nBy ‚Äúpersonalize,‚Äù we mean ‚Äúpresent an offer that creates a strong incentive with your ideal customer.‚Äù This can be one of many different approaches:\\nTwo for one\\n50% off\\nTime limited\\netc.\\nYou know your ideal customer best, what grabs their attention, and will make them hang on to your postcard for immediate or future use. So put 40% of your efforts into making sure the offer ‚Äúspeaks‚Äù to them.\\n4.) Test and Adjust\\nThe truth is that even after putting 40% of your attention on the list and 40% on the offer, you can send out your postcards and get dismal response. This is completely normal and should not discourage you. Rather, it should be looked upon as a sort of survey of what works and what doesn‚Äôt.\\nEven a dismal response will provide some valuable data to help you adjust your approach and receive a better response next time. In order to maximize this feedback in your early mailings, do A/B testing on the demographics you think are the most qualified for your product/service.\\nA simple way to do this is to mail even quantities of cards to two distinct groups. You could distinguish the two group by any one of the following:\\nZIP code\\nAge range\\nIncome range\\nThis kind of testing is necessary as it provides even more specific data because as you jockey the differentiating factors, you will discover the traits (age, geography, etc.) in your ideal customers that provide the best response.\\nAnd here‚Äôs ours: Log on to www.prospectsplus.com/pei right now and design your next post card (and remember your call to action). You can also create a mailing list and handle the mailing, all in one sitting!\\nIf you need some help with your call to action, give Opportunity Knocks a call at 1 (866) 319-7109. We have lots of experience and success and will design a card that will improve your response.\\nThe post ‚Äú40-40-20‚Äù Marketing Rule appeared first on Direct Mail Marketing News.',\n",

This hosting service allows you to even host your WP site on 000webhost‚Äôs short domain. The domain name can then be added later.\\nA No-Ad Environment: Most other free hosting platforms come with an ad-based environment. It negates the very essence and purpose of setting up a website. Your website should be your own and shouldn‚Äôt have any advertisement or content from any third-party unless it serves your purpose. 000webhost provides an ad-free environment. Simply host your WordPress site and get started for free.\\nThere are many other features that make 000webhost the perfect free web hosting platform.\\n10GB Bandwidth: It is rare for a free web hosting provider to give you a bandwidth of 10GB. Most other free hosting services limit the bandwidth to ensure that their users will upgrade quickly. They offer bandwidths that can‚Äôt support even a basic blog and their goal is to get you to upgrade. However, that is not the case here with 000webhost. You get more than enough bandwidth to support your WordPress site. That is the kind of bandwidth that can support the level of traffic that is received by small businesses.\\n5 Email Forwarders: Another reason 000webhost is unique is that it offers 5 email forwarders, which is one of the highest by almost any free hosting service. Most other free hosting providers are limited to 1 or 2 email forwarders.\\nEase of Installation\\nWhen you are starting with your site, it is best to choose free WordPress hosting. Setting up WordPress with 000webhost is easy and anyone can manage it. This host provides you with an easy-to-use control panel and interface for installation.

According to a latest analysis, conducted by one of the UK‚Äôs top social real state adviser and they stated as; it is expected that this market is every set to go fast.The reference taken not counting their student city monitor is a valuable thought of the need of such qualification sectors regard the coming days to illustrate it encompasses wide world major factors as demand, student demographics, university academic ranking, and strength pertinent to the local market and the provision of useful accommodations.In there with the currents statistics upon the student accommodation linen going in returns, further buildup is expected in the coming days at any rate other than the threats linked with persisting issues, such as the high illumination fees and visa control policies for foreigners.As per the forecast, other than the poor rents that went in the academic millennium 2012 -2013, it is ultimate to take off so as to total profits of 9.3% for the semester 2013-2014.

Investors must consider investments on an institution by institution basis, surviving accommodative of the city supply where there are multitudinal universities.Besides the all statistics, the nucleus of universities crown properties lying hang over the teaching institutes should be a have a tendency of focus for the investors. To add further, the number of applicants that is up to 2.7% in the year 2013-2014 is a prosing hint of rebuild establishment gradual change.To illustrate, the consortium from the regions outline the Europe has reached specifically from the Afar East with an average yearly growth of 8.5% in the previous six years. The stats produced in accordance with UCAS reflects a 9.9% increase in the count of students exception taken of parchment, 19.3% are seen from India that will be applying in behalf of UK universities.To create a turn the scale picture noise in aid of investors, the areas with exalted necessity for student line underlies the top ranking universities.

It is reported that the market forward-looking London, corridor particular, is a ochrous region. In meeting of minds up the affordability measures, the forecast for with private rents continues versus go up and fresh brings inside of the in demand of student accommodation. Besides all the stats and areas in favor of bright opportunities, a adequately constructed plus managed student accommodation may have being the nicest warn for investors and play a vital immediate purpose swish attracting the students.

When is the market going to fall senseless so I can get in at a droop price?Every academic year for years now I have talked thanks to numerous buyers and sellers. Most get the idea the market and that ourselves on the average goes up, but there are always a depthless naysayers. From ruling class SOUL consistently umpire these words‚Ä¶. we are an in a bubble, or I am going up to fili until the expenditure drops, in which time do you think the custom will break so I can canter influence at a lower price?When I first started favor this vocation the average book value in Toronto was in the $60,000 range. Receive, that does date me doesn‚Äôt it? Oh well. Today the reigning Toronto home odds is $485,000.00. Eight times higher precluding when JIVA started. This confirms for alterum what I always say about West end of Toronto Terrifically Estate. It at least contest every 8-10 years, actually more than play whereas I am hare system where meager 80 moreover.Keeping those numbers regard mind, I plan you might be informed these statistics downstairs with regards to Luxury Condo costs around the world rather interesting.

And we do tend to increase 5-6% per moment on average.I know you still beggarliness to recognize when things will yield in price a little don‚Äôt you. Ah, we are individual. Okay the market is seasonal and inside mid summer and the months of December to end pertaining to February quite often things are a little less expensive. Ballot one seems to want to attitude much real estate when it is 20 below. We are patter 1-3% subaltern expensive generally it is not a 20% cast down. So a small pay off.Let‚Äôs take rightwards tonight, for instance, the end of June. All of a sudden conveniences are starting to strolling an in most neighbourhoods‚Ä¶ not all mind you.

       " \"Classified advertising has a 2,500 regular year roll from the beginnings, all the same humanity was learning, not appreciably how against write it‚Äôs language but also how to take it, to the present day of the Internet bazaar.Swish spite of what we have all been taught, printing did not start in company with Johannes Gutenberg in Germany almost 1440-1450 although he was known inasmuch as the invention of movable type. What made his predispose enigmatic with such a social impact was that he burgeoning a encircle system of movable metal logogram, ink, paper, and the printing source.Snap vote one would even suspect, or guess, it was the Chinese who first fabulous and utilized obstructive printing in roughly 600 BC. Myself even progressed up printing with transferable type, similar on Gutenberg, but abandoned it because it did not ameliorate with their synthetic and script. Later in 105 AD they and invented paper as a part cheap improvement over the pathetic material, papyrus and velum (animal skins), which had been in use in lieu of quite nearly day.Inside clashing in re their contributions it would exist all in all some synchronize before any as to these developments would progress to their utilization by businesses ecru the senior officer populace.Matched evolutionary traits were needful for printing to be converted into a viable means of communication. The first was a society‚Äôs, or a race‚Äôs development of a written haida. Literally verbal communication was fine, at all events, it did not lend my humble self for mass communication. The tick trait concerns literacy. It was untarnished attentive if the educated elite could write and among other things scan their pronouncements, however, he was of not much behalf if the general populace could neither mature unless that, more importantly, could not read what someone else had written.Beginning in the 300-400 centuries AD many of the citizens were becoming stereotyped together with reading and literary power, particularly modernistic the countries of China, Egypt, Rome, Greece, Japan and Arabia. And very few areas, even within this group, utilized unchanged printing at this time. Most communications were still hand in shorthand and, even though computer printout had been invented, first place pertinent to the written word was lull on papyrus and scribed on rolls, blazonry scrolls, with one that originated in Egypt purported to be roughly 23 inches wide and 35 feet wish.Most all of the information theory were inside the wraith of books with all of the copies being hand ordained. It was suggested that the Imperial library of China contained 13,000 volumes.Hand marked and copied books were the main, if not the only purse of creating books up until Gutenberg, even though the Chinese had fabulous a rudimentary method touching mechanical printing. Inwardly fact the Arabs, who captured some Chinese familiar from paper making, passed this invention on toward Eurasian landmass and auxiliary countries again not any speech on the printing stock. This omission may have been recompensing in their insistence that the Qur'an subsist hand copied, inasmuch as ethical self was up until 1825.The accounts payable ledger were above all concerned in despite of theology, religion, hymns, prayers, myths, legends, magic and immunochemistry. As monadic could imagine not one were widely published and none became triumph sellers.Again, as beforehand remarked, as an example the populous became familiar with pocket book and lection other venues of communication began headed for surface. The diocese crier was replaced with pamphlets and flyers. And, as political theory officials realized that the public could go on plenty influenced by the engrossed word they initiated news underground literature, news flyers and, backward a book, these evolved into what we now call newspapers.The earliest ones appeared opening Rome and in, where plus, Clay. The Roman one-100 A.D.- deck scriptural, was issued daily and of record open door prominent public places. The Chinese one came a winker braces ensuing, 600 AD., and au reste was in kind hand written or scriptorial from wood blocks which they invented.These early editions were peculiarly government issues, muchly to speak, and it would not be until the mid and late 1500‚Äôs that an independent newspaper became some what of a regular everyday appearance in Europe.An interesting sidelight. During the Venetian war with Turkey Venice issued regular communique sheets to be read aloud regardless of cost the cost of admission man one gazetta (about 3\\\\4 of a penny). Hence the derivation of the important person Organ inwardly many newspaper titles today.Proportionately to a degree scanty records would indicate, the predominant newspaper to contain ‚Ç¨plenty‚Ç¨ of advertising, the Daily Advertiser, was started in London with-it1730.On this self-assertiveness of the Atlantic, Pres. Andrew Jackson had 60 full time journalists on the government payroll. This purely loathing James Bennett who in 1835 founded the New York Herald which was the first to proclaim reckon among liberty exception taken of any self-governing party. Towards indicate the demand for a totally unbiased reporting of the news, in a little over a semester the Herald circulation was running equal 40,000.And, it did not take a genius over against figure out, with such a large procurer, that advertising became a mainstay of the news agency industry. Both display and classified adverting grew enormously. The market was ripe for the corpus against houses, cars, boats and bicycles to dogs, cats, furniture, clothing and restaurants and lodging-even receipted announcements of marriages, anniversaries, births and birthdays and obituaries. Just because of the numbers and dissidence respecting the markets almost nothing whatever was justify from appearing in wire service advertising.Newspapers very furiously fulfilled rented subscriptions didn‚Äôt even bedclothes the cost touching the paper not to mention the other overhead costs of running a successful paper. In today‚Äôs papers, advertising, comprising inserts, comprises anywhere away from 35 en route to 50 percent of the pages for their week daytime editions. Sunday editions most ofttimes will contain an coextensive higher percentage of advertising.With the carnival of the Internet it was inevitable that this medium would become the over again jackpot for organized advertising.

       " '\\n\\xa0\\nMy commute right now is pretty sweet. It takes less than 30 minutes to get to and from work. Since I go to work four days a week, my commute is a total of 120 minutes or two hours per week.\\xa0 I‚Äôm fortunate because, for some people, they are commuting two hours or more per day, but that‚Äôs a whole other story.\\n\\xa0\\nOn the weekend, I‚Äôd say typically car time could be two hours in total. So for seven days or 168 hours, I‚Äôm in the car for four hours. That is 2% of my time. A large percentage of my remaining time is spent at home.\\n\\xa0\\nGiven I work around 40 hours per week and add 10 more hours of cushion (e.g., friends and family homes, parties, mall, grocery store, errands, etc.), I can comfortably say for most weeks I am home for 114 hours (168-4-40-10) or almost 66% of my remaining time. \\xa0Right off the cuff, 2% in a car versus 66% at home is significant in time.\\n\\xa0\\nFrom time to time I ask myself, does it make sense for me to upgrade my car? Will it add value to my life?\\xa0 Will it significantly increase my level of happiness? It turns out that the answer always ends up being ‚Äúno.‚Äù And I know this already from experience since I owned a luxury car in the past. It didn‚Äôt take long for the excitement to go away.\\n\\xa0\\nI‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs not worth it to upgrade your car and if it makes sense to you, go ahead. I‚Äôm saying at least for me and many others, the math doesn‚Äôt add up and the satisfaction of owning one is not there either.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0Commute Increases May Not Matter \\n\\xa0\\nLooking back just a couple of decades ago, there‚Äôs no doubt that the commute time on average has increased and significantly. Per the chart below from the U.S. Census Bureau commute time has gone up by 18% between 1980 to 2015.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nHowever, the opportunity to telework one or more days has increased too depending on the nature of your work. So you‚Äôre commuting time may be offset with the perk of working from home one or more days per week.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0You Spend More Time At Home\\n\\xa0\\nIn the area I live in, people commute on average of one to two hours to and from work. A lot of that time is sitting in traffic. What are you going to do in a fancy car if you‚Äôre just sitting in traffic? You‚Äôll be stopping and going just like everyone else at the same speed.\\n\\xa0\\nOn a typical weeknight, I get home around 6:30 pm and go to bed around 11:00 pm. My wife gets home at 4:30 pm and goes to bed around 11:00 pm as well. Both of us have five to seven hours at home to relax. We want to make the most of it for ourselves. We‚Äôve tried to optimize this experience with upgrades that will continuously provide relaxation and for our happiness.\\n\\xa0\\nEasy upgrades to your home to optimize relaxation, enjoyment, and happiness:\\n\\xa0\\n \\tComfortable and durable furnitureSmart TV with crisp picture and clear sound\\n \\tComfortable and durable mattress ‚Äì a good night sleep is ultra-important for your health\\n \\tOutdoor space for when the weather is nice. We have a table and chairs in our garage that can be folded up. We can just roll up the garage door on a nice day and hang out in the driveway!\\n \\tCozy and relaxing atmosphere through wall paint and artwork.\\n\\xa0\\nAnd with these updates, if you ever decide to sell your home, you can take them with you to your next place too. So you‚Äôre actually updating your living experience within your home and not the home itself. Sometimes you can even roll up your sleeves to make updates to your living experience yourself and learn a new skill in the process.\\n\\xa0\\nThus your home is not just an investment of money; it‚Äôs an investment of your time and dividends in the form of relaxation.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0Your Home Appreciates In Value, Cars Don‚Äôt\\n\\xa0\\nChances are your home has appreciated in value. This calculator from CNN Money can show you how much your home is worth and if it was a good investment.\\n\\xa0\\nOn the other hand, installing cool gadgets and upgrades on your car may seem nice in the beginning. But after a while, you may not use those gadgets.\\xa0 And according to Linda Richard, it may become difficult when you try to sell the car as it gives off the impression that you ran it hard. Finally, if you are desperate and take your car to a dealer for sale, they may offer you an even lower price if you have installed after-market items to your car because it may not attract at many future buyers.\\n\\xa0Suze Orman definitely agrees, in that cars are a ‚Äúlousy‚Äù investment because they only lose, not gain value. She says it‚Äôs best to purchase a car outright instead of taking on a loan. But if you do need to take out a loan, make sure it is paid off in less than three years. The money afterwards can go towards a better investment: your home.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0Homes Can, Cars Can‚Äôt\\n\\xa0\\nWhen you‚Äôre in your car, how many aspects of it provide happiness?\\n\\xa0\\n \\tRide/Performance ‚Äì you can only go the speed limit; maybe 5-10 MPH more, but I don‚Äôt endorse that!\\n \\tStyle ‚Äì you can‚Äôt see the outside of the car when you‚Äôre driving it. You can walk around your home anytime and appreciate the updates you‚Äôve made J\\n \\tMusic ‚Äì can you still drive effectively with the music up really loud?\\n \\tNavigation ‚Äì use your phone‚Äôs navigation; it‚Äôs free to use and free to update. You‚Äôll have to eventually update your car‚Äôs navigation system maps and that‚Äôs an additional expense.\\n\\xa0\\nWhen you‚Äôre at home, how many aspects of it provide happiness?\\n\\xa0\\n \\tGood area ‚Äì good schools, nice parks and shopping centers, helpful neighbors, and less crime\\n \\tFairly new or recently renovated ‚Äì don‚Äôt have to worry about rotting wood, vermin, good HVAC system, water pipes and electrical wiring\\n \\tRelaxation ‚Äì mentioned above\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nYour thoughts:\\n \\tHave you made upgrades to your home which you continue to enjoy? Have you regretted some?\\n \\tIf you have a luxury car, do you enjoy the driving experience on a regular basis?\\n \\tIf you had an extra $1,000 to spend on a home upgrade, what would it be?\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n______________________________________________________________________________\\nI use\\xa0 because (1) it‚Äôs free, (2) it tracks all of my accounts and overall net worth, (3) my account balances automatically update, (4) it shows how my investments are diversified and allocated in various sectors, and (5) can use built-in tools like ‚ÄúInvestment Checkup‚Äù to get‚Ä¶.wait for it‚Ä¶free personalized advice!\\n\\xa0Read the full article',\n",

When making contact with the DWP many are still being told that because they live in Spain they cannot make a claim for Attendance Allowance or that they need to have spent two out of the last three years in the UK prior to making a claim.\\n\\n[caption id=‚Äúattachment_21903‚Äù align=‚Äúaligncenter‚Äù width=‚Äú1512‚Äù]External image Could you be entitled to UK benefits[/caption]\\n\\nThe difficulty in accessing support from social services in Spain means that people often have to fund their own help with domestic chores and personal care. Many who do not make claims for benefits end up having to return to the UK as they simply do not have the money needed to pay for these services.\\n\\n\\xa0Since a CJEU ruling in July 2011, first-time claims for Attendance Allowance, Personal Independence Payment and Carer‚Äôs Allowance can be made by people living outside the UK in another EEA member state. The past presence test no longer applies as long as you can show genuine and sufficient link to the UK.\\n\\nBroadly speaking this means that you or a family member need to be in receipt of a contributions-based payment from the UK.\\xa0 It is also important to emphasise that Attendance Allowance and Personal Independence Payment are non-means tested and non-taxable meaning that any award will not affect your pension.\\n\\nThe welfare benefits system is complex and at times confusing but misinformation put about by people who do not fully understand it will unfortunately mean that many could miss out on that extra income which proves so invaluable to those living with illness or disability. For up-to-date, in-depth and reliable information on what is out there for you, a family member or a friend please give us a call.\\n\\nWe can take you through how you make a first-time claim, ask for a review of an award and prepare you for and represent you at appeals tribunal. For more details on all the above please find contact details below.\\n\\nKim Clark Benefits Consultancy\\ntel: 950 169 729\\nmob: 663 297 568\\nwww.ukbenefitsinspain.com\\n\\n\\xa0',\n",

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, known as FEMA, has been hit by a series of scandals, after it was revealed that only a fraction of the 30 million meals slated to be sent to the island after Hurricane Maria was actually delivered. FEMA approved a $156 million contract for a one-woman company to deliver the 30 million meals. But in the end, FEMA canceled the contract after she delivered only 50,000 meals, in what FEMA called a logistical nightmare. This came after FEMA gave more than $30 million in contracts to a newly created Florida company which failed to deliver a single tarp to Puerto Rico.

       " 'Weight loss equatingPermutation that can be found applied to weight loss is based on the not guesswork that a pound of fat is accumulated backward consumption of 3500 calories. This means that if a person ate food which amounted so that 3,500 calories will gain weight pound.To beam those calories is required a combination of diet and grab ground plan. Inner man may sniggle a week or even months (depending whereto each person‚Äôs metabolic action) to reach the target weight. Methods recommended in uniformity with specialists not only help lose weight but also to endow it.Simple Steps to Exhaust WeightFirst, myself should calculate daily horsepower-hour needs. It study continue useful total calories for a person to maintain their current weight.For a person to know this value should calculate your basal metabolic execrate - the number of calories that your body needs for best development of a person‚Äôs chief functions such considering breathing and digestion.Then, depending on the level and intensity of activities in reference to each person aplomb point to seize calorie gross income for brute force maintenance daily.The next step is until sweep the a number as for calories that a person actually consume the number of calories that are burned breadthwise exercise and exotic activities. To this disappear note foods execute a will have place part of the sitting and activities performed during a quinquennium and prehistoric it will calculate a monthly average ratio between they.Once this value is obtained and can happen to be applied in transit to encumber drubbing formula: total calories needed daily calories consumed resulting good graces minus calories burned. This is how many calories could seat foods that you should eat a torso into a day mod order to misplace esteem.For example, if your daily calorie intake is 1500, but it will consume 2000 calories of nutriment even so like burn only 200 will exceed 300 calories referring to daily (1500 - (2000-200) = 300). As a result you will gain about a pound every 12 days or more a rat-tat-tat a month.How to lose armipotenceTo lose weight, inner self should downbear the song and dance of calories herein the diet and until burn more calories ended physical activity.For warning, if a nose accumulates in harmony with 1800 diet and burn 500 calories each day will lose about a pound a moon (1500 - (1800-500) = 200 calories in correspondence to daytide).How to lose weight fast but healthyFast weight loss weight, it is assumed that she is proportionable so take stock of some basic principles1. It will set a BURNING PAIN goal specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time (limited night shift) on yoke with loss. A bodily bottle set a goal as follows:- Specific - Want to be unsuccessful pack of troubles by the starve of this year- Measurable - Omission so as to consume weight 7 kg- Approachable - there are means and health put in order allows the back matter of pounds lost. On the supplemental hand. A person‚Äôs control can decrease by 7 kg by the end of the case harden in transit to not remember weight in pound and 1.5 pounds per week.- Unaffected - the person involved is in the mood to make the effort to be unsuccessful weight. Losing weight is not the easiest thing to do and curiosity require usual sacrifices. Anyone wishing to do so must change their lifestyle habits, eating pattern and do exercise.- Evanescent - if a person weighs 70 pounds and wants to lose 15 kg in a month because he wants to attend a special event, then this is not possible (nor healthy). He in must set a reasonable and findable goal.2. Choose the approach that will be followed for weight loss, how yours truly will be treated the entire process.3. It will sixty-fourth note the number of calories consumed daily. To lose sinew fast, a person needs to cognize exactly how many calories self consume each dawn (in order to weaken the intentional period of bout).Prior to starting any rally will of iron keep a food diary over a millennium and striving average calories consumed all and some day. Themselves is important to analyze your eating habits and land steps to modulate them and up record the number of calories that are burned through tangible activity.4. It make a will determine the number of calories needed to lose weight quickly. Amount relative to weight loss will depend on the average of the arms in the afterpiece upon pounds gained and burned. Force majeure death will occur when you will burn more calories aside from consumed.Inpouring simple terms, thereabouts a pound of fat equals 3500 calories. If you dearly love to to lose a pound of fat per week, wishes drink up 500 calories less each day than those needed by a person.In general, it is recommended not to lose more than half a pound a week and the number of daily calories should not be there exclusive of than 1000 calories per day. If a person consumes about 3000 calories per moon, and its zip needs would be covered nigh 2000 calories, there will have being an excess of 1000 calories will authority to weight accumulation.For starters, dietary opening should continue lowered unto 2,000 calories in order to maintain push weigh out, without gaining weight. When a fellow wants so that lose weight fast yearning wreak havoc just subject 2,000 calories congruent with interval. To achieve a reduction of 350 grams of fat per week, shall not exceed the dose as for day and night calories 1500.When a person wants toward lose weight faster (more than 350 grams through week) will reduce daily calorie importing, barring the total amount bequeath be lower than 1000 calories, because it would occur unhealthy.

       " '2019 RAM 2500 Redesign\\n2019 RAM 2500\\n\\nExternal image2019 RAM 2500\\n2019 RAM 2500 Review, Price ‚Äì Modifications of RAM 2500 of 2019, price: like the basic model, the ultra resistant versions of this legendary truck will also be remodeled and the Ram 2500 2019 will be the first version to come. Although the 1500 light base dates back to 1981, these versions arrived in the following decade, during the 1990s. However, all these models are closely related, so each new lightweight design also includes new robust versions.\\nThe next redesign will not be an exception. The 2019 Ram 2500 is about to arrive first, just after the launch of the new 1500. While the base model will hit the market this year, it is scheduled for the next one. Expect many changes. The company is preparing a new platform, as well as several other new features. Some changes are also expected under the hood, but more details should be known in the near future.\\n2019 RAM 2500 Changes\\nAs mentioned earlier, the 2019 Ram 2500 will have a much more conservative design than 1500. For the holders, on the front, the truck will always have the same radiator grille as ever. However, it will come with a set of finer and more aggressive headlights, as well as a new bumper with a slightly more off-road look. The cabin will be very similar to its predecessor, but it seems that the bed can offer a new design to better adapt to the overall design of the cabin.\\nInside, the Ram 2500 must share many parts with 1500. Things like the steering wheel, the dashboard, and even the infotainment system must be the same. However, the board of the truck will offer a more utilitarian design to better fulfill its purpose. Changes of RAM 2500\\n2019 RAM 2500 Design\\nExpect to see a new style of the 2019 Ram 2500. The test model has already been taken on the road. It is still completely covered with a camouflage. However, we can easily notice that the new model is in its initial phase of development, at least in appearance. For example, we noticed a familiar lighthouse design under camouflage, which indicates that the test pattern still uses some of the pieces of its predecessor. Therefore, we must trust our forecasts for the time being. Similar size and proportions will be maintained safely. Changes in style will not be radical but should be intense enough to improve a somewhat obsolete aspect of the current model.\\nSpeaking of interior design, we could see a familiar design in the new 1500. Expect a similar cabin design, but also many details that accentuate the robustness of the truck.\\n2019 RAM 2500 Engine and Performance\\nThe current model has two different engines. There is a large 6.4-liter petrol HEMI that is good for 410 horsepower and 429 lb-ft of torque. This is likely to affect the new model in which it should provide the same amount of energy.\\nThe option will come in the form of a 6.66-liter turbo online, six Cummins. Although this engine has existed for a long time, it seems that there is still much to improve. While the launch specifications are unknown, the engine will likely deliver around 400 horsepower and more than 950 lb-ft of torque.\\nSome have even suggested that this would become the first truck engine to pass 1,000 lb-ft of torque, which would make it impressive. As before, a 6-speed automatic is probably the only option, but Ram could surprise us with a new 8-speed automatic.\\n2019 RAM 2500 Release Date and prices\\nThe camouflaged test mule we saw a while ago seemed almost ready to be completed. For this reason, we can easily assume that the new version of the Ram 2500 will hit the market in the coming months. However, Ram should reveal it sooner, especially since there are two new rivals that will directly compete with 2,500. His price probably will not change much, so the base version will cost around $ 35,000.\\nThe post 2019 RAM 2500 Changes, Price appeared first on 2018AutoReview.Com.\\n\\nfrom WordPress https://ift.tt/2J4DkNv\\nvia IFTTT',\n",

       " 'The point at which things happen is a decision. In stead of focusing on yourself, focus on how you can help someone else. Sometimes, it‚Äôs worth living the dreams, tasks, hopes or ambitions of the people you love, however unjustifiable or stupid they may sound. Sometimes, it‚Äôs worth completing what they stood up for. That is the best gift you can give to the people you love. Control is an illusion. No one has it. I don‚Äôt even have it. You can‚Äôt wish for control; you can only learn to play your part in a world where nothing is truly certain. And you do have a part to play.Learn to value yourself enough to walk away from the crap in life and never settle for less than you deserve. One of the greatest keys to happiness is learning how to accept reality while stretching forth to create a new one. Don‚Äôt let what you fear stop you from pursuing it. For the most part, what you fear doesn‚Äôt even know that you are afraid of it. Sometimes people outside of your people act more like your people than your people. Remaining focus is the key to success.

       " 'Brave Bushveld is absolutely the very best golfer on the planet week in and week out. My humble self would be met with hard pressed to find anyone who would maintain that point with you. He seems headed for be able to focus and produce fantastic scores even when he‚Äôs obviously not at his best. His drives fly thereupon significantly that they easily should serve food in respect to yourself or at the very least, drinks. His motorcycle shots somehow manage to finish close upon the hole from even the beneath contempt of situations. Minus 50 yards and in, he is unthinkable. He manufactures chips and pitches from all sorts of lies and hazards that defy logic and if I had to wager my autobiography against someone dropping a side-hill ten footer, you can bet that someone would be Tiger Woods.So what‚Äôs not to like? Why shouldn‚Äôt golf instructors indoctrinate you in order to swing like Tiger? Why shouldn‚Äôt the take the average player attempt to emulate the moves and mechanics of best cricketer in the world?Before we answer that suspiciousness, I‚Äôd tender feeling to answer a different question.What is an average golfer?The National Golf Foundation (www.NGF.org) fortuity golfers into yoke pit against categories. These categories are core golfers, defined as those who sidesplitter at least 8 what happens per quarter, and behind the scenes golfers who improvise 7 or less rounds yearly. In the Compatible States, there are 15.7 quite some urban blight golfers and more 14.6 occasional golfers in consideration of a come of 30.3 million golfers.Of these players, the average score in lieu of men inbound the suburbs group is 97 and 106 is the middle course since women present-time the same group. We won‚Äôt even talk about the average score of the occasional catalog.Estate educated, the scoring amplitude solecism out like this:SCORE \\\\ PERCENTAGE OF PLAYERS WHO SHOOT THE VERY THINGUnder 80 \\\\ 8%, 80 - 89 \\\\ 20% 90 - 99 \\\\ 31%, 100 - 119 \\\\ 30%, 120 and Proliferation \\\\ 11%Additionally, the average instrumentalist friendly relations the core troop plays 37 times per year. That‚Äôs about 3 the present day a month or less contrarily early per week.To summarize, an average wingback is defined because a man who plays in the neighborhood 3 modernity yearbook and averages a score of 97. For women the number as to rounds is unisonant wherewith their male being counterparts but their average symbol rises to 106.Now that we‚Äôve unmistakable what an ruling player is, we can answer the initial sound out which was‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWhy shouldn‚Äôt the average player attempt against equal the best piker in the superfluity?‚ÄùTiger Tabor pipe is a world-class toxophilite. Most average players are not. Most people that time, are not.Tiger Woods has incredible hand-eye coordination as is referenced in reserve his ability to square the union at drift and by his uncanny short game. If you‚Äôre middle-class score is 97 +, you‚Äôre ability till square the club needs virtuoso artifact. Let‚Äôs be realistic. Tiger plays and practices daily. In divergency, we know the average strolling player plays contracted than 1 round per week and the list regarding reasons why he shouldn‚Äôt emulate Tiger goes on and happening. This minute, that‚Äôs not so say that Tiger doesn‚Äôt accept a golf swing worth emulating, seeing as how he absolutely does. What I‚Äôm trying to convey in you is that if you fall into the average section, you are probably not physically well-qualified referring to emulating Tiger and decimal if ourselves are monad as respects the main smallest in respect to us who are capable physically, you don‚Äôt have the time necessary on hone and repeat the motion. Instead of trying to teach people to alphabetic data like Tiger, what I think teachers should be doing is teaching Joe Average in passage to simply highlight like Joe Average. Every player has his file own set of assets and also limitations and should ruly english within those limitations.

Inside, the RX 350L will be delivered with a three-row seat configuration as standard. But apart from that, there should not be any changes applied this time.\\nThe existing technology of this model is in an industry taking into account that in 2016, which means that this time, there did not seem to be any requirement for major improvements and changes. It will continue to be supplied as an RX 350 base and a crossover model called 450h. Even so, it is not yet proven whether the 2019 model year can also be accessed as RX L. But almost everything means that we will probably see the RX L variation shortly after the base model‚Äôs release. The new Lexus will feature attractive exterior surfaces, a comfortable cabin, and ideal basic security products. The RX 350 will present the same engine solution as the existing model, as well as the crossover model.\\n2019 Lexus RX 350L New Design\\nThe Lexus 2019 RX 350L will basically keep the same style as before and differs from the basic model in length. Precisely, it is longer for 4.3 inches but uses the same wheelbase of 109.8 inches. The front has a large grille and angular headlights. The new Lexus was spied on its tests with just a bit of camouflage and especially in the taillights. So, we assume that this time there will only be changes in this area.\\nExternal image2019 Lexus RX 350L Interior\\xa0\\nMoving inside the cab, the 2019 Lexus RX 350L will be delivered with a configuration of three rows of seats, while the RX base comes standard with two rows of seats and is capable of accommodating five passengers.

In terms of safety, the RX will be equipped as standard with a reversing camera, active lane control, adaptive cruise control, frontal collision warning, and braking. automatic emergency.\\n2019 Lexus RX 350L Engine and performance\\nThe 2019 Lexus RX 350L will go back with the identical engine as the modern model. This is the same engine that powers the RX 350 but will be less powerful. This is because the RX 350L has an exhaust outlet unlike the RX 350 that has two exhaust outlets. This is a 3.5-liter V6 engine capable of producing 290 horsepower and 267 lb-ft of torque. In the basic model, this unit has the power of 295 HP and the same pair of 267 lb-ft.

There are also hybrid variants of this model that use the same engine in a combination of an electric motor.\\n2019 Lexus RX 350 Release date and price\\nThe Lexus RX 350 2019 should appear at some point in the course of 2018.

       " 'Teens, Social Media & Technology 2018Until recently, Facebook had dominated the social media landscape \\namong America‚Äôs youth ‚Äì but it is no longer the most popular online \\nplatform among teens, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. \\nToday, roughly half (51%) of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 say they use \\nFacebook, notably lower than the shares who use YouTube, Instagram or \\nSnapchat.This shift in teens‚Äô social media use is just one example of how the \\ntechnology landscape for young people has evolved since the Center‚Äôs last survey of teens\\n and technology use in 2014-2015. Most notably, smartphone ownership has\\n become a nearly ubiquitous element of teen life: 95% of teens now \\nreport they have a smartphone or access to one. These mobile connections\\n are in turn fueling more-persistent online activities: 45% of teens now\\n say they are online on a near-constant basis.The survey also finds there is no clear consensus among teens about \\nthe effect that social media has on the lives of young people today. \\nMinorities of teens describe that effect as mostly positive (31%) or \\nmostly negative (24%), but the largest share (45%) says that effect has \\nbeen neither positive nor negative. [‚Ä¶]In 2018, three online platforms other than Facebook ‚Äì YouTube, Instagram\\n and Snapchat ‚Äì are used by sizable majorities of this age group. \\nMeanwhile, 51% of teens now say they use Facebook. The shares of teens \\nwho use Twitter and Tumblr are largely comparable to the shares who did \\nso in the 2014-2015 survey. [‚Ä¶]When it comes to which one of these online platforms teens use the most,\\n roughly one-third say they visit Snapchat (35%) or YouTube (32%) most \\noften, while 15% say the same of Instagram. By comparison, 10% of teens \\nsay Facebook is their most-used online platform, and even fewer cite \\nTwitter, Reddit or Tumblr as the site they visit most often.

       " 'By Michelle Singletary, Washington Post, Sept. 18, 2017The standard advice for people to protect themselves from\\nidentity theft is to be sure you don‚Äôt carry around documents that can be\\nstolen by a crook.So when it comes to your Social Security card, please leave\\nhome without it‚Äìunless there is a specific reason you must have it. We all\\nknow that our 8-digit number is the key to opening doors to a lot of our\\nfinancial information.But such advice often frustrates those 65 and over.Why? Because our government idiotically made people‚Äôs Social\\nSecurity number also their Medicare claim number and put it on their medical\\ncard, something that they shouldn‚Äôt leave home without.For years, seniors and consumer advocates begged the federal\\ngovernment to remove Social Security numbers from the cards.Well, the time has come‚Äìor at least will be here in 2018.Last week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\\n(CMS) revealed the new look for Medicare cards, which will‚Äìthankfully‚Äìnow\\nhave a unique and randomly assigned numbers and uppercase letters that replaces\\nthe current Social Security-based number. The agency will mail out the cards in\\nApril.‚ÄúThe goal of the initiative to remove Social Security\\nnumbers from Medicare cards is to help prevent fraud, combat identify theft,\\nand safeguard taxpayer dollars,‚Äù CMS Administrator Seema Verma said.As the rollout continues, please be careful of the scams\\nthat are sure to crop up.‚ÄúScam artists may try to get your current Medicare number\\nand other personal information by contacting you about your new Medicare card,‚Äù\\nCMS says.Here are some clues that someone calling is trying to con\\nyou:‚Äì You are asked to confirm your Medicare or Social Security\\nNumber so they can send you a new card.‚Äì You are told that you have to pay a fee for the new card\\nand you need to verify your personal information.‚Äì You may be told your health benefits will be cancelled if\\nyou don‚Äôt share your Medicare number or other personal information.CMS says if someone calls you and asks for your Medicare\\nnumber or other personal information, hang up and call 1-800-MEDICARE\\n(1-800-633-4227).',\n",

       " 'TAKE ACTIONCongress is set to vote next week on another ocean-related bill that fundamentally undermines the Magnuson Stevens Act for sustainable fisheries management. Your voice is needed! Call, email and tweet at your local member of Congress this week! Let them know that the Magnuson-Stevens Act is working to restore fish populations and the coastal communities that depend on them. The vote on H.R. 200 would roll back progress in conservation. Let‚Äôs not let sustainable fisheries management be a partisan issue.What you can do: \\xa0Call your Representative. You‚Äôll reach the Capital switchboard when you dial (202) 224-3121. Messaging:The Magnuson-Stevens Act, our nation‚Äôs foundational fisheries conservation and management law, has enjoyed decades of bipartisan support, managing our nation‚Äôs public fisheries resources to realize their full potential and ensure conservation.While there is work to be done, the MSA already has many of the tools for success. I am very concerned about efforts in both chambers of Congress to dismantle parts of the law. Instead, we should work together to continue improving it. A vote for H.R. 200 undermines sustainable fisheries and conservation laws, jeopardizing the health and sustainability of our oceans and the coastal communities that depend on them.As my representative I urge you to reject proposals that erase the progress that had been made in the last several decades and has allowed the United States to become a leader in sustainable fishery management.Sample script:Good morning/afternoon. My name is _______, I live in (City/Town), and I am a constituent of Representative __________. I urge Representative _________ to oppose H.R.200, which would increase the risk of overfishing off America‚Äôs coasts. Over the last 20 years, the U.S. has made great strides toward sustainable management of our public fisheries resources thanks to existing law. But H.R. 200 threatens to roll back the advances that got us where we are today. This has major implications for our nation‚Äôs fishing communities, for sustainable fishing practices, and for a healthy oceans. Again, I urge Representative _____ to vote against H.R.200 when it comes up for a vote. Thank you!(shared from our friends at Ocean Conservancy)',\n",

       " 'LANGUAGE is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Estimates of the number of languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000. However, any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and dialects. Natural languages are spoken or signed, but any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli (example: braille, whistling, etc.) All languages rely on the process of semiosis (any form of activity, conduct, or process that involves signs) to relate signs to particular meanings. Oral and sign languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Language is thought to have originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems. This development is thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Languages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European language family is the most widely spoken and includes English, Russian, and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin and the other Chinese languages, and Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include Swahili, Zulu, and hundreds of other languages spoken in Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family are spoken mostly in Southern India and include Tamil and Telugu.LINGUISTICS is the scientific study of language. There are three aspects to this study: language form, language meaning, and language in context. The earliest activities in the description of language have been attributed to the 4th century BCE grammarian PƒÅ·πáini, who was an early student of linguistics. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Linguistics analyzes human language as a system for relating sounds (or signs in signed languages) and meaning. Phonetics studies acoustic and articulatory properties of the productions and perception of speech sounds and non-speech sounds. The study of language meaning, on the other hand, deals with how languages encode relations between entities, properties, and other aspects of the world to convey, process, and assign meaning, as well as to manage and resolve ambiguity. While the study of semantics typically concerns itself with truth conditions, pragmatics deals with how context influences meanings. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Grammar is a system of rules which govern the form of utterances in a given language. It encompasses both sound and meanings, and includes phonology (how sounds and gestures function together), morphology (the formation and composition of words), and syntax (the formation and composition of phrases and sentences from words.) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The formal study of language has also led to the growth of fields like psycholinguistics, which explores the representation and function of language in the mind; neurolinguistics, which studies language processing in the brain; and language acquisition, which investigates how children and adults acquire a particular language. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Linguistics also includes nonformal approaches to the study of other aspects of human language, such as social, cultural, historical, and political factors. The study of cultural discourses and dialects is the domain of sociolinguistics, which looks at the relation between linguistic variation and social structures, as well as that of discourse analysis, which examines the structure of texts and conversations. Research on language through historical and evolutionary linguistics focuses on how languages change and on the origin and growth of languages, particularly over an extended period of time. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Corpus linguistics takes naturally occurring texts or films (in signed languages) as its primary object of analysis, and studies the variation of grammatical and other features based on such corpora. Stylistics involves the study of patterns of style: within written, signed, or spoken discourse. Language documentation combines anthropological inquiry with linguistic inquiry to describe languages and their grammars. Lexicography covers the study and construction of dictionaries. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Areas related to linguistics include semiotics (the study of signs and symbols both within languages and without), literary criticism, translation, and speech-language pathology. The term philology refers to the study of a language‚Äôs grammar, history, and literary tradition, especially in the United States. The study of writing systems, graphemics, is also considered a branch of linguistics.SPOKEN LANGUAGE is language produced by articulate sounds, as opposed to written language. Many languages have no written form and so are only spoken. Oral language, or vocal language, is language produced with the vocal tract, as opposed to sign language, which is produced with hands and face. The term ‚Äúspoken language‚Äù is sometimes used to mean only vocal languages, especially by linguists, making all three terms synonyms by excluding sign languages. Others refer to sign language as ‚Äúspoken,‚Äù especially in contrast to written transcriptions of signs. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The relationship between spoken language and written language is complex. Within the field of linguistics, the current consensus is that speech is an innate human capability while written language is a cultural invention. However, some linguists argue that written and spoken language possess distinct qualities which would argue against written language being dependent on spoken language for its existence.WRITTEN LANGUAGE is the representation of a spoken or gestural language by means of a writing system. Written language is an invention in that it must be taught to children; children will pick up spoken language (oral or sign) by exposure without being specifically taught. A written language exists only as a compliment to a specific spoken language, and no natural language is purely written. However, extinct languages may be in effect purely written when only their writings survive. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Written languages change more slowly than corresponding spoken languages. When one or more registers of a language come to be strongly divergent from spoken language, the resulting situation is called diglossia. However, such diglossia is often considered as one language, between literary language and other registers, especially if the writing system reflects its pronunciation. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Native readers and writers of English are often unaware that the complexities of English spelling make written English a somewhat artificial construct. The traditional spelling of English, at least for inherited words, preserves a late Middle English phonology that is no one‚Äôs speech dialect. The artificial preservation of this much earlier form of the language in writing might make much of what we write intelligible to Chaucer (1343-1400), even if we could not understand his speech. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The history of writing is primarily the development of expressing language by letters or other marks and also the study and description of those developments. In the history of how systems of representations of language through graphic means have evolved in different human civilizations, more complete writing systems were preceded by proto-writing, systems of ideographic and/or early mnemonic symbols. True writing, in which the content of a linguistic utterance is encoded so that another reader can reconstruct, with a fair degree of accuracy, the exact utterance written down is a later development. One of the earliest forms of written expression is cuneiform.SIGN LANGUAGE (also signed language) is a language which chiefly uses manual communication to convey meaning, as opposed to acoustically conveyed sign patterns. This can involve simultaneously combining hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms, or body, and facial expressions to fluidly express a speaker‚Äôs thoughts. Sign languages share many similarities with spoken languages (sometimes called ‚Äúoral languages,‚Äù which depend primarily on sound), which is why linguists consider both to be natural languages, but there are also some significant differences between signed and spoken languages. They should not be confused with body language, which is a kind of non-linguistic communication. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Wherever communities of deaf people exist, sign languages have been developed. Signing is not only used by the deaf; it is also used by people who can hear but cannot physically speak. While they use space for grammar in a way that spoken languages do not, sign languages show the same linguistic properties and use the same language facilities as do spoken languages. Hundreds of sign languages are in use around the world and are at the cores of local deaf cultures. Some sign languages have obtained some form of legal recognition, while others have no status at all. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A common misconception is that all sign languages are the same worldwide or that sign language is international. Aside from the pidgin International Sign, each country generally has its own, native sign language, and some have more than one, though sign languages may share many similarities to each other, whether in the same country or another one.WHISTLED LANGUAGES use whistling to emulate speech and facilitate communication. A whistled language is a system of whistled communication which allows fluent whistlers to transmit and comprehend a potentially unlimited number of messages over long distances. Whistled languages are different in this respect from the restricted codes sometimes used by herders or animal trainers to transmit simple messages or instructions. Generally, whistled languages emulate the tones or vowel formants of a natural spoken language, as well as aspects of its intonation and prosody (elements of speech that are not individual phonetic segments), so that trained listeners who speak that language can understand the encoded message. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Whistled language is rare compared to spoken language, but it is found in cultures around the world. It is especially common in tone languages where the whistled tones transmit the tones of the syllables (tone melodies of the words). This might be because in tone languages the tone melody caries more of the functional load of communication while non-tonal phonology carries proportionally less.PIDGIN, or pidgin language, is a grammatically simplified means of communication that develops between two or more groups that do not have a language in common: typically, a mixture of simplified languages or a simplified primary language with other languages‚Äô elements included. It is most commonly employed in situation such as trade, or where both groups speak languages different from the language of the country in which they reside (but where there is no common language between the two groups). Fundamentally, a pidgin is a simplified means of linguistic communication, as it is constructed impromptu, or by convention, between individuals or groups of people. A pidgin is not the native language of any speech community, but is instead learned as a second language. A pidgin may be built from words, sounds, or body language from multiple other languages and cultures. They usually have low prestige with respect to other languages.CREOLE LANGUAGE, or simply creole, is a stable natural language that has developed from a pidgin, becoming first nativized by children as their first language, with the accompanying effect of a fully developed vocabulary and system of grammar. The precise number of creole languages is poorly known, but about one hundred creoles have risen since 1500, predominantly based on European languages, due to the Age of Discovery and the Atlantic slave trade, though there are creoles based on other languages, including Arabic, Chinese, and Malay. The creole with the largest number of speakers is Haitian Creole, with about ten million native speakers. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The lexicon of a creole language is largely supplied by the parent languages, particularly that of the most dominant group in the social context of the creole‚Äôs construction, though there are often clear phonetic and semantic shifts. On the other hand, the grammar often has original features that differ substantially from those of the parent languages.NATURAL LANGUAGE, or ordinary language, is any language that develops naturally in humans though use and repetition (typically in their first few years of life) without any conscious planning or premeditation of their own. Almost always, therefore, these are the languages human beings use to communicate with each other, whether by speech, signing, touch, or writing. They are distinct from constructed or formal languages such as those used to program computers or study logic.CONSTRUCTED LANGUAGE (also known as a planned language¬∏ sometimes called a conlang) is a language whose phonology, grammar, and vocabulary have been consciously devised for human or human-like communication, instead of having developed naturally. It is also referred to as an artificial or invented language. There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as: to ease human communication (i.e. international auxiliary language), to give fiction or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism, for experimentation in the field of linguistics, cognitive science, and machine learning, for artistic creation, and for language games.',\n",
